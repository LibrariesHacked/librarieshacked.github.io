As mentioned in the [last post on this blog], about the Arts Council basic libraries dataset, the Office for National Statistics have released some analysis of travel times. For England and Wales, headline figures are:

- 42.5% of people are within 15 minutes walk of their local librry
- 77.7% of people within 30 minutes walk
- 92.8% of people within

Here's a riddle though. The walking time between my house and my local library is 14 minutes. It's also a 20 minute walk between the library and my house. What? Is that the difference when taking the scenic route? No, although that's always a nice distinction to make, as well as considering safe routes.

It's the difference between going to the library or coming back from it, along the same route. Going there is downhill, and coming back is up.

So am I within 15 minutes walk of my local library?

We should look back at the ONS data and see what they actually did. The cover notes on their spreadsheet say they worked with Ordnance Survey, who have a routing network for analysing walking routes (and other travel modes). In this case it doesn't look like elevation is taken into consideration. Once they calculate the route they use the distance and a walking speed of 4.8km per hour, which apparently closely follows 'Department for Transport Journey Time Statistics'. The libraries are defined as destinations in the analysis so it's a walking route to the library, but presumably would make provide the same results if going back home.

Anyway, it's fine - it's a good analysis, and you could pick holes in all these things until perfect becomes the enemy of good. But it would be interesting to explore the difference between travelling to and from the library.

You can try this for your local library on Google Maps. Find your local library and put it as a destination from your home, then switch the source and destination and it'll likely show a different travel time.

In these sorts of anaylses what is most valid? Travelling to a=or from the library? You have to do both really don't you?

I'm always interested in extremes, a colleague of mine once analysed the worst rail replacement bus services you could be faced with. In one case the road route was 4 times as long as the rail, and would also be much slower.

what's the most extreme example of a difference in travel time betwen going to your local library and walking back? It's really hard to say as we'd really need to test every home and their local library.

What we can do is look at catchment populations though and compare the catchment population moving away from a location, and the catchment population for travelling to a location.
