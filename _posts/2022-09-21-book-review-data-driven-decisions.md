A review of Data-Driven Decisions: A Practical Toolkit for Library and Information Professionals. This is available from [Facet Publishing](https://www.facetpublishing.co.uk/title.php?id=9781783309799) and other bookshops. I was given a temporary review copy by the publisher but have also bought an ebook copy.

Introduction

> Whatever your reason for picking up this time today, I hope it allows you to love and use data a little bit more than you did before.
> **Taken from 1. Introduction**

The context for this book gives a comforting background to the author's history, which is an effective way of making it more accessible to those from backgrounds outside of data work. You don't need to be good at maths, or to have even ever enjoyed maths, to be able to use data. You don't need to love data (yet), but hopefully you will by the end of the book.

The introduction is also effective in tying data analysis to the challenges library services are facing: 




Data analysis . This feels like a book that tackles all those problems. It brings a personal, .



It feels like it is jargon-free, not just by self consciously trying to remove jargon, but because that is the way the author has learned the techniques and 







### The toolkit



The toolkit takes the form of six steps, each presented as chapters. These are Identify, Collect, Map, Analyse, Act, and Review. This is pretty similar to many similar guides you'll find, 



There are some aspects off the guidance where it feels like the development of the toolkit, primarily through personal experience has led to underlying bad practice, or at least 

I'd take an alternate view on this. Rarely save data, and when you do delete it. The key is not to store data as you go, that creates duplicate copies of the underlying source data and always leads to trouble in terms of data retention and archive policies, as well as just being bad for data storage and carbon footprint.



What it is always necessary to save, as you go through steps of analysing and . Effectively. If there are 10 steps to go from the data source into a format then you want to save those steps to make that process repeatable, not the 10 copies of the data at each stage.


It is also not a self-proclaimed 'best-practice' book or a data science manual.

This fairly short review took quite a long time to write. There are normal life things that caused that: chicken pox, holidays, busy work, etc. But also due to the nature of the book. It's not a book you read and then put down and get on with your life. So I read it, then wrote a bit of review. Then went through again quickly to remind myself of bits. And then looked at it from time to time while doing aspects of data analysis that were relevant to the instructional aspects of the toolkit, to compare my own practice with the author's.

To get the most out of it would be read in chunks. And treating as a reference book to refer to, while undertaking the different stages of data analysis.


Data analysis is neglected in multiple sectors. But it's also an essential  This feels like a book that tackles all those problems. It brings a personal, .

The audience for the book is an interesting one because it is the professional library staff member, but not professional data analyst. 

It feels like it is jargon-free, not just by self consciously trying to remove jargon, but because the author has learned the techniques and methods through experience rather than formal training.






### The toolkit

The toolkit takes the form of six steps, each presented as chapters. These are Identify, Collect, Map, Analyse, Act, and Review. This is pretty similar to other guides you'll find and is a good structure to follow to do targeted data analysis.

I don't know if those linear steps are as useful as they once were. I'd like to read more thoughts on a holistic approach to data stewardship, management, and analysis that takes into account the whole data lifecycle. A library service, in fact any service, needs to understand the data that they collect and generate

Recent organisations I have worked with that are advanced in data analysis think less for example about the collection . Data is often collected 

But that's likely to be beyond the power of the majority of library staff. The flaws in a 


There are some aspects of the guidance in the toolkit where it feels like bad practice, or at least practice that that could lead to bad habits.

One example is in the encouragement to save data frequently.

But minor quibbles, and in many ways personal preference. It's neither a self-proclaimed 'best-practice' book or a data science manual, it's one expert in the field sharing their experience and knowledge and techniques they have built up over time.


### Is it useful?

Even disagreeing with methods is useful and interesting, not just for the different perspective, but because it triggers thinking about why you do things the way you do.

But it's definitely a guide

In reality that is a huge number of people. A recent Open Data I
