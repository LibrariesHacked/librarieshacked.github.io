I've recently read Data-Driven Decisions: A Practical Toolkit for Library and Information Professionals. This is available from [Facet Publishing](https://www.facetpublishing.co.uk/title.php?id=9781783309799) and other bookshops. I was kindly given a temporary review copy by the publisher, but have also bought an ebook copy after many delays in finishing this review!

### Introduction

> Whatever your reason for picking up this time today, I hope it allows you to love and use data a little bit more than you did before.
> **Data-Driven Decisions. Taken from 1. Introduction**

The introducton to this book gives a comforting background to the author's history, and makes it particularly accessible to those from a background outside of data work. You don't need to be good at maths, or even to have ever enjoyed maths, to be able to use data. You don't need to love data (yet), but hopefully you will by the end of the book.

This seems particularly important in the library sector, at least from my (relatively limited) experience. A lot of people who are very good at their jobs, but who are not confident in their data skills are given the task of managing data, and are left to figure it out for themselves. That doesn't create a scenario in which they can begin to love data, which is really just being able to love libraries. If you are in any way curious about the operations of your library, or the people who use it, then in many ways data is the only way to expolore those things.


The introduction is also effective in tying the (better) use of data to the challenges library services are facing: 




Data analysis . This feels like a book that tackles all those problems. It brings a personal, .




It feels like it is jargon-free, not just by self consciously trying to remove jargon, but because the author has learned the techniques and methods through experience rather than formal training.

So, long story short, the introduction, context, and need for the 


### The toolkit

The toolkit takes the form of six steps, each presented as chapters. These are Identify, Collect, Map, Analyse, Act, and Review. This is pretty similar to other guides you'll find and is a good structure to follow to do targeted data analysis. They're also well covered, with plenty of good examples, and with the same jargon-free approach.

To some extent it feels like the book falls down slightly in the detail of how the go about data analysis. There are some aspects of the guidance in the toolkit where it feels like bad practice, or at least practice that that could lead to bad habits.


I'd take an alternate view on this. Rarely save data, and when you do delete it as soon as possible. The key is not to store data as you go, that creates duplicate copies of the underlying source data and always leads to trouble in terms of data retention and archive policies, as well as just being bad for data storage and carbon footprint.



What it is always necessary to save, as you go through steps of analysing and . Effectively. If there are 10 steps to go from the data source into a format then you want to save those steps to make that process repeatable, not the 10 copies of the data at each stage.



I don't know if those linear steps are as useful as they once were. I'd like to read more thoughts on a holistic approach to data stewardship, management, and analysis that takes into account all data held and provides steps for generating insight from it. A library service, in fact any service, needs to understand the data that they collect and generate

Recent organisations I have worked with that are advanced in data analysis think less for example about the collection . Data is often collected 

But that's likely to be beyond the power of the majority of library staff. The flaws in a 




But minor quibbles, and in many ways personal preference. It's neither a self-proclaimed 'best-practice' book or a data science manual, it's one expert in the field sharing their experience and knowledge and techniques they have built up over time.


### Is it useful?

Even disagreeing with methods is useful and interesting, not just for the different perspective, but because it triggers thinking about why you do things the way you do.

But it's definitely a guide

In reality that is a huge number of people. A recent Open Data I
