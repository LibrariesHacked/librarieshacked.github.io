A review of Data-Driven Decisions: A Practical Toolkit for Library and Information Professionals. This is available from [Facet Publishing](https://www.facetpublishing.co.uk/title.php?id=9781783309799) and other bookshops. I was given a temporary review copy by the publisher but have also bought an ebook copy.

The key is not to store data as you go, that creates duplicate copies of the underlying source data and always leads to trouble in terms of data retention and archive policies, as well as just being bad for data storage and carbon footprint.



What it is always necessary to save, as you go through steps of analysing and . Effectively. If there are 10 steps to go from the data source into a format then you want to save those steps to make that process repeatable, not the 10 copies of the data at each stage.


It is also not a self-proclaimed 'best-practice' book or a data science manual.
