### 1. More fine-free libraries
To be fair to Scotland, they've had loads of fine-free libraries for ages. 

But generally in the UK this is a phenomenon  of the past couple of years.

### 2. Open data standards

There are a few library services publishing open data about themselves: Plymouth, Newcastle, Leeds, Calderdale. These will grow as library services catch up with other services in local government.



### 3. Hackathons

### 4. Making use of open source

### 5. Software written by libraries for libraries

### 6. Mobile library resurgence

### 7. Tackle the data backlash

### 8. Ditch CIPFA

### 9. Data-informed decision making

### 10. Digital declaration
