The best dataset about UK public library usage is easily Public Lending Right (PLR). It's my favourite and the greatest, and is described [on the British Library PLR website](https://www.bl.uk/plr).

> PLR is the right for authors to receive payment for the loans of their books by public libraries

The essential process is this:

1. The PLR team select a sample of UK library authorities to report their borrowing data

4. Authors must apply to register their books, audio-books, Ebooks and E-audio-books.

4. A calculation is made for how much each author should receive. A total of £6m is available (provided by the DCMS), with a minimum payment amount set to £1 and a maximum of £6,600. A rate per loan is then set that fits those thresholds. In 2018 this rate per loan was 8.20 pence. 

5. Payments are made annually on the basis of loans data collected from a sample of public libraries in the UK
6. The money is supplied to the DCMS. 

A lovely process, and it's good to see authors reimbursed for the repeated use of their works in libraries. Authors tend ([except Deary](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/13/libraries-horrible-histories-terry-deary)) to be on the side of libraries anyway, but it must help that they have some reimbusement.


### What could it be used for?


The primary function of the data is to pay authors for the lending of their work. But is does feel like a huge and amazing dataset that is currently being underused.

The goal of making data open and more widely available is not to suggest all the ways in which it could be used. That always remains to be seen, and would be delivered by other people. But, at least a few things spring to mind:

- It is by far the best dataset for measuring library usage over time. CIPFA has annual issue figures collected over many years but CIPFA define issues as including any renewal
- Far more interesting than just simple loans figures this is 
- I would like to see library catalogues (and other book search sites) display this data. When a user looks at the detail


### Is it open?

OK, show us the data then. Well, there doesn't seem to be any as such.

The PLR team have long provided [annual media reports](https://www.bl.uk/plr/uk-media-centre) about PLR data. Things like the top 100 authors and books each year, in different regions.

They have also in the past been very amenable to giving access to the LEWIS system (Loans Enquiry Web Information Service). As far back as 2014 the PLR team said I was welcome to login to LEWIS and look through the PLR data. This is an online tool to query the loans data from 1995 to 2015. This looks and feels very like [OLGA](https://www.plr.uk.com/olga/login.aspx), the system used by authors to manage their online account with PLR, and was presumably developed by the same team.

1995 to 2015? What about 2016 and 2017 at least? Well, I don't know. In the last couple of years PLR responsibility has been transferring from an independent team based in Stockton on Tees to a British Library office in Boston Spa. The [latest newsletter](https://www.bl.uk/britishlibrary/~/media/bl/global/services/plr/pdfs/newsletters/2018newsletter.pdf) describes a number of changes including

>  Our aim is to make efficiency savings by relocating PLR operations to sit alongside other corporate functions and to implement a new IT application taking advantage of new technology which, as well as adding new functionality, will support modernisation. 

That sounds very good, although also potentially sounds like bad news for LEWIS being updated. Data must still be being collected, and in July 2018 this was updated to also include ebook loans, but perhaps the changing of teams and IT systems will mean that data will not make it into the online query tool.

The query tool itself was a little bit clunky. It allowed you to search for a particular ISBN and year so you could see the loan counts per library service for that item. It also allowed you to browse through all the ISBNs for a single year, in pages of 20. There were no data tools however, such as just exporting to spreadsheet. To look through every ISBN that had been loaned in the UK library sample would probably take years.

### Automation

Which is where computers come in. Because computers can do things like that quickly.
