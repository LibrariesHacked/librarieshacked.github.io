In December I ran a survey to find out what people might want from a digital library community.

The introduction ran as follows:

> This is an anonymous survey to gauge interest in forming a community of library digital, technology, and data practitioners.
>
> Anyone involved or interested in libraries and digital/technology developments would be welcome, regardless of how you perceive your level of expertise. This would include library staff at all levels and sectors, suppliers and other interested organisations, and library users.
>
> Any group would be community-led, and independent of individual organisations.
>
> **A digital library community survey**

Firstly, thanks to everyone who took the time to complete the survey. And who shared it on social media. Particular thanks to [Artefacto](https://www.artefacto.org.uk) who shared it widely, as well as giving essential feedback and guidance on the survey.

What are my reference points for the kind of community or events that could be possible?

In 2017 and 2019 Claire Back, Aude Charillon, and I, organised a couple of 'Library data unconferences', named Voyage of the Data Treader 1 and 2. These followed the usual unconference format (attendees pitching ideas for sessions), with sessions about all things library data. But we also arranged training by invited speakers, such as Owen Stevens who presented on using OpenRefine, and Jason Evans who gave an introduction to Wikidata (both really great learning sessions). There are plenty of things that could be improved about those events, but they didn't lack enthusiasm from the attendees, and it was great to see staff from different areas keen to share ideas and learn from each other.

I've attended and presented at tech meetup groups, where a regular event is held and a speaker volunteers to present on a topic. These are good to learn about new things, and for networking with other people. For the volunteer speakers they are opportunities to practice their presentation skills, and get feedback on their ideas within a welcoming environment.

I've also been impressed by events like [Library Camp](http://www.librarycamp.co.uk/), which were unconferences for library staff without specifically being about data. Follow up [Failcamp](https://www.artefacto.org.uk/failcamp-librarycamp-and-the-power-of-unconferences/) events allowed people to share failures and learn from them.

I've helped run 'hackathons' within a community interested in local data (e.g. air quality, environmental health). These are longer events where people get together to work on a project or idea. These are great for getting away from the day job and working with new people to try something out.

But these are personal experiences. There are a huge variety of types of event or group. There are library networks like [the JiscMail lists](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/mailinglists/a-z/index.html). But I'm not sure if they are the right place for informal discussions and sharing of ideas. There are also communities like the [Libraries Connected Innovation network](https://www.librariesconnected.org.uk/training-and-events/innovation-gathering-2023) but that's more of a closed community, specifically for public library staff.

So, what might people be interested in? Here are the results from the survey.

### Do you feel there is a need for a cross-sector community to discuss technology and digital developments within libraries?

| Yes | No  |
| --- | --- |
| 97% | 3%  |

Surely it's obvious people filling out a survey on a digital library community would be interested in such a community?

It felt worth checking whether the premise was correct to start with. The results seem to bear out that need, for the majority of respondents.

### Would you be interested in being part of any of the following (choose as many as apply)

| Option                                                                      | Response |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| An online community such as a forum, or chat platform                       | 97%      |
| A regular meetup group that run short sessions (e.g 1-2 hours)              | 57%      |
| A conference with pre-arranged speakers and topics                          | 41%      |
| An unconference where attendees propose and choose discussions at the event | 54%      |
| A training event that provided workshops and hands on materials             | 51%      |

By far the most popular was the option of the online community. As people could select as many options as applied, I imagine that's due to universal appeal and access. Physical events have access problems, with geography, work, and other barriers.

None of the options were particularly unpopular.

### Which of the following topics would you be most interested in (choose as many as apply)

| Option                                               | Response |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Library websites and online catalogues               | 65%      |
| Digital transformation                               | 65%      |
| User experience (UX)                                 | 68%      |
| Web development                                      | 43%      |
| Library management systems                           | 38%      |
| Accessibility                                        | 46%      |
| Data (e.g. Analysis, Big data, Data ethics)          | 76%      |
| Open knowledge (Open source, Open data, Open access) | 68%      |
| Digital marketing                                    | 30%      |
| Library metadata                                     | 49%      |
| Hardware (e.g. kiosks, 3D printers, RFID)            | 38%      |

Big hitters overall were User experience, Data, and Open knowledge. Digital transformation, Library websites and online catalogues were also popular. I'm conscious that these are probably all things of particular interest to myself, and so likely to be over-represented in the results for a survey I promote. But, does that matter? In general it's good to se a wide range of topics all get good feedback, and shows that a community wouldn't struggle for topics of discussion.

### If attending an event or meetup would you prefer that it were in-person, online, or hybrid (a mix of both)

| In-person | Online | Hybrid |
| --------- | ------ | ------ |
| 14%       | 27%    | 59%    |

I was slightly surprised at the popularity for hybrid events, and the low response for in-person. I understand the need for hybrid, it's just often a challenge to deliver in a way that works. To some extent I prefer online-only as there isn't a divide between people online and those in the room. But hybrid clear winner here.

To think about more...

### What sector do your work or are most interested in?

| Sector            | Response |
| ----------------- | -------- |
| Public            | 53%      |
| School            | 0%       |
| Higher education  | 11%      |
| Further education | 8%       |
| Prison            | 0%       |
| Health            | 3%       |
| National          | 3%       |
| Special           | 21%      |

I've kept the typo in the question (should be 'what sector do **you** work...') but hopefully it didn't cause confusion!

Respondents were primarily public, likely again due to the my own interests. But there was a good spread of other sectors, and not a suggestion that the community shouldn't be cross-sector.

Other was quite high. That may have been libraries that don't fit into the other categories, or people who work in other sectors but are interested in libraries. It would be good to know more about that but if its people not directly working in libraries but interested in them in general, then that's good as well.

## Next steps

So where to go from here? There are no definitive answers from the survey but there are useful pointers to the type of events, the topics, as well as people making it clear that online participation is something they want.

There were some generous offers of help in the responses (which includes a comments section) so I'll be followig up on those and trying to arrange a short meeting to discuss next steps.
