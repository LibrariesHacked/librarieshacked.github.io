I've been considering plans for the Libraries Hacked project for 2021.

## Library lab

There were a few Libraries Hacked projects in the last couple of years that share similar situation. Primarily the [Mobile libraries project](https://www.mobilelibraries.org/), [Libraries at home](https://www.librariesathome.co.uk/), and [Library map](https://www.librarymap.co.uk/). 

* They are prototype applications. Not finished products, but showing what could be done with certain library data
* They could do with further input: collaboration on code, branding, user experience expertise, and data knowledge.

To bring projects like that together into a single place I've launched [Library lab](https://www.librarylab.uk/). This is a place to hold ideas about prototype digital applications - where anyone can get involved and contribute.

It would be great if 2021 could have more of these, plus developing the existing ones, and getting others involved. If you're interested, have an explore!

## Mobile apps

I have a new iPad, a new Android phone, and an itch to do some mobile app development. Nothing extravagant, but it would have to be something that made use of the phone/tablet rather than something a responsive website could do.

One idea was to write an app that kept track of your current library loans and sent you notifications when they were due to return. No sharing or posting to social media, just something for people to use for themselves. It would be 'real' checking, as the app would know how to query library accounts on library websites on your behalf. Then automatically renew loans just before they go overdue. All the data (including credentials) would be stored securely on your personal device.

I'd use it!

## More reading

There is very little original thought. I enjoy old writings about libraries. My latest obtained book on Mobile libraries, "Mobile Libraries & other public library transport" (by C.R. Eastwood) was written in 1966, but doesn't seem irrelevant in any way.

So more of that needed - tools change, politics and situations change, but it would be silly not to look to learning where it's available in books.

## Collaboration

There are 49 repositories on the [Libraries Hacked GitHub page](https://github.com/librarieshacked). These are all projects, some long term, others one-off. And with the code available to view.

However, open source is not just about making code visible. One of the benefits is to enable collaboration.

I've been really pleased that a couple of times in the last month other people have contributed code to Libraries Hacked projects. It would be amazing if that continued.

## Talk to the public not libraries

UK public libraries are low staffed, underfunded, lacking in digital training, and busy. It's something to be fought, but it's true. With some amazing exceptions, they don't have little sympathy for extending digital services, prototyping digital applications, or releasing open data. Not through negativity for those things, just enough on their plate.

And coming to that realisation has been important. Being a library user, the projects I most enjoy are ones that have a public focus rather than a library service one.

For example, I'd like to experiment with alternative library websites. Providing facilities like browsing books, placing reservations, managing loans, but taking the opportunity to explore doing those things in ways they haven't been done before.

But that doesn't require direct input from library services, it would be purely related to the public experience of using libraries. It makes sense to involve the public more.

## Sponsorship

I try to avoid projects that involve money. The process of estimating, invoicing, and getting money is hard. I'm fortunate to have a job that pays a reasonable wage through normal taxed pay, and that is enough. (If you use freelancers, please pay them promptly!).

That being said, Libraries Hacked costs money. The cloud hosting for the databases and web applications, plus some things like domain names and certificates comes to almost Â£1,000 a year. 

GitHub offers a way for developers to be sponsored for the things they do, and I'm exploring [the GitHub sponsors programme](https://github.com/sponsors). Perhaps there could be a situation where organisations wanted to sponsor specific projects and could directly fund some of the hosting costs.

Still to be decided though. And definitely not interested in revenue through ads.

## Mind

I don't think I'll be pushing for fundraising for library hacking until things are looking better in the current crisis. Certainly more worthwhile at the moment would be to [donate to Mind](https://www.mind.org.uk/donate/) to tackle the mental health emergency.

My incredibly clever and very dear brother was found dead while living alone earlier this year. An existing mental illness had flared up during furlough in the first lockdown, and he'd found things too much. I'm sure there are many such cases, 2020 will have devastated many families. I've listened to Nick Cave's recent song Hollywood a lot recently, where he wisely puts it "everybody's losing someone".

I'd like to explore more about mental health and digital services. People often consider the best digital services to be those that achieve a function most efficiently, or simply. And there's certainly beauty in that. But I'm not so sure anymore.

Like going travelling and taking a bus, or a train. In theory the bus or train should be judged on how quickly, comfortably, and cheaply they get you to your destination. But the reality becomes that sitting on the train, looking out the window with a coffee and some music is the most enjoyable part of going away. I suspect the same can be true of digital services.

I don't think we consider enough the mental health benefits of digital services, and how much pleasure they can give. With library services we have such appreciation for physical aspects of libraries, smelling books, sitting quietly in the library, all those great things. But there is as much in the digital, and I'd like to think about that while working on projects.
