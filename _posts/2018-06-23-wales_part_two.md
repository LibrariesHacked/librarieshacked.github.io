In a previous post I looked at [Wales library locations](/wales-part-one), and how using location data allows for assessment of areas and how close people are to libraries, particularly with regard to the Wales public library standards. This used library locations taken from Wikidata, thanks to the [Libraries in Wales](https://www.cilip.org.uk/members/group_content_view.asp?group=200145&id=733577) project from [Kathryn Parry]() and [Wikimedia Jason Evans](https://twitter.com/wiki_nwl).
