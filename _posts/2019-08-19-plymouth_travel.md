One of the long-running and award-winning (won a tshirt) #librarydata projects is a library finder. This uses Plymouth Libraries' open data on library locations, facilities, and opening hours. Like most projects, it is never finished.

See [plymouth.librarydata.uk](https://plymouth.librarydata.uk)

Plymouth Libraries have embraced open data, releasing [various datasets about their service](https://www.plymouth.gov.uk/libraries/aboutlibraryservice/librarydata), as well as the Council holding a library themed [DataPlay event](http://www.dataplymouth.co.uk/articles/data-play-9-itinerary), inviting the public to get involved with library data.

One of the datasets is [Libraries in Plymouth](https://www.plymouth.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Plymouth%20library%20locations%2C%20opening%20hours%20and%20services_0.csv), a listing of the 12 libraries, with their address and opening hours.

## Library information

Boring names and locations of libraries? What's the use of that? People can look on Google. Well, hopefully there is more use to having library locations, but before getting in to that it was worth considering what other information was available about the libraries. Such as 'Photocopiers (colour and black/white)'.

This seemed like something worth getting into 

### Facilities

If you're searching for a library you may have a particular task in mind. You want to use a computer, a printer, a DVD, investigate local history etc. If you want to browse books you can probably expect that in any library but for some of the other things you may need to check ahead.

Plymouth publish a list of services and facilities on the website page for each of their libraries, such as [Central Library](https://www.plymouth.gov.uk/libraries/findlibraryandopeninghours/centrallibrary).

### Events

Libraries have events going on. So those should be represented in data about libraries.

Plymouth library events are listed on their website. 

[This script]() runs throughout each day, updating a data file of Plymouth library events. The events are then published.

### Buildings

Normally when you plot a library on the map it will show some kind of icon. Maybe a book, or just a stanndard map marker. But what about showing the actual library? Libraries are physical buildings and it would be nice to have some kind of representation of that when viewing them on a map.

### Ordnance Survey

What's know as the base 'map tiles' are provided by Ordnance Survey. They have designed a map that changes as you zoom in and out, . The product is called Open Zoomstack, and there are 4 different styles available: light (the one used). 

It is slightly customised.
