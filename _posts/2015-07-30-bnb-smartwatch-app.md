With the Apple watch, various Android watches, and Microsoft [releasing the Band](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-band/en-gb), 2015 may still be set to be the year of the smart watch. Though this telegraph article suggests in terms of **wearables** it is the [year of the smart bra](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/predictions/technology/11306735/wearable-technology-trend.html).

#### Pebble

Pebble is a Kickstarter crowdfunded smart watch, the second generation version holds the record for highest funded project at around $2 million. It is also relatively cheap (the first one Â£80), integrates with iOS and Android phones, and includes a cloud based-development environment, [CloudPebble](http://cloudpebble.net).

Although it is yet to be seen how successful the second watch will be, or how popular smart watches will turn out to be in general, Pebble is at least a fun learning tool for writing simple watch apps that make use of the features of the watch paired with a phone.

Like hybrid apps on phones, Pebble has created an option for developers to write apps (**watchapps**), purely using a JavaScript library, **Pebble.JS**. A [basic guide to Pebble.JS](http://developer.getpebble.com/guides/js-apps/pebble-js/) on the Pebble site shows how to set up an app.

As an example, this app will:

- query the [British National Bibliography](http://bnb.bl.uk/) (BNB) for a book published in the user's current location
- also query for a book **set** in the current location

#### Setting up the app

The app can be written within the cloud pebble environment, which includes a simulator for testing.  All the code is written within a single app.js file. CloudPebble also allows integration with GitHub, so the full code for this app is located at [bnb-books-pebble](https://github.com/LibrariesHacked/bnb-books-pebble).

After following steps in the [guide to starting cloud pebble development](http://developer.getpebble.com/guides/js-apps/pebble-js/), the initial set-up of the app is to design the screen, which consists of a single UI 'card' with title, subtitle, and body text.

<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><code>var ui = require('ui');
var ajax = require('ajax');
// test location for use in simulator
var testLocation = { coords: { latitude: 51.94, longitude: -2.26 } };

// Create and display the main UI card - values can then be dynamically changed
var main = new ui.Card({
  title: 'BNB Books',
  subtitle: 'Search for local books',
  body: 'Push buttons!'
});
main.show();</code></pre>

#### Handling events

The code needs to perform actions when each button on the watch is pressed. These are available as JavaScript **events**, so event handlers are written in the same way as traditional web-based JavaScript (such as clicking a button on a webpage).

The Pebble watch has three buttons. Top, middle and bottom. Using the top and bottom buttons, in the code below each action triggers a call to get the current location (**navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition**).

The Pebble watch itself does not does not have an Internet connection, or the ability to detect location - all these features are obtained via a Bluetooth connection to a phone. The JavaScript library hides that though, and handles the communication between the phone and the watch.

<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><code>var locationOptions = { timeout: 15000, maximumAge: 60000 };
// variable used for tracking the current function (which button was pressed)
var currentFunction = '';
// up button (top) will find books published in the current location (BNB)
main.on('click', 'up', function(e) {
  currentFunction = 'published';
  navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(reverseGeocode, handleError, locationOptions);
});
// down button (bottom) finds books set in the current location (BNB)
main.on('click', 'down', function(e) {
  currentFunction = 'setin';
  navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(reverseGeocode, handleError, locationOptions);
});</code>
</pre>

#### Getting location

The **navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition** method takes in three arguments. These are:

- a method to run when the location has been retrieved;
- a method to run if there is an error;
- options for the request to get position (such as a how long to wait before failing - a timeout value).

In the example above, once the location is retrieved, both actions go on to run a method called reverseGeocode.

#### What is reverse geocoding?

**Geocoding** is getting location co-ordinates (typically in latitude and longitude) from descriptive location data (such as an address). In the case of data from GPS, we start off with the co-ordinates and want to turn that into something descriptive (e.g. Tewkesbury). This is **reverse geocoding**.

Open Street Map can be used for reverse geocoding. A single call to a URL (**http://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/reverse?**), passing in the latitude and longitude will return an address, which can then be used for querying the BNB.

<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><code>function reverseGeocode(pos) {
  pos = testLocation;
  var lat = pos.coords.latitude;
  var lon = pos.coords.longitude;
  var url = 'http://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/reverse?format=json&addressdetails=1&lat=' + lat + '&lon=' + lon;
  ajax( { url: url, type: 'json' },
    function(data, status, request) {
      if (currentFunction == 'published') getBookPublished(data.address);
      if (currentFunction == 'setin') getBookSetIn(data.address);
    },
    handleError
  );
}</code></pre>

#### Querying the BNB

The BNB data has an open SPARQL endpoint, allowing remote querying. It also has a [test editor online](http://bnb.data.bl.uk/flint-sparql) for trying out queries.

It is well worth reading [Leigh Dodds' 4 part series](http://blog.ldodds.com/2014/10/08/an-introduction-to-the-british-national-bibliography/) introduction to the BNB, as well as looking through the GitHub repository here for a great [set of sample SPARQL queries](https://github.com/ldodds/bnb-queries).

Rather than showing the JavaScript code to pass through SPARQL queries, these are two example queries that would be used to find books set and published in Gloucester.

#### Books published in a location

<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><code>PREFIX bibo: &lt;http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/&gt;
PREFIX blt: &lt;http://www.bl.uk/schemas/bibliographic/blterms#&gt;
PREFIX dct: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/terms/&gt;
PREFIX event: &lt;http://purl.org/NET/c4dm/event.owl#&gt;
PREFIX rdfs: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#&gt;
SELECT ?book ?title ?isbn ?timeLabel ?creator ?name WHERE {
  ?place rdfs:label "Gloucester" .
  ?publication event:place ?place.
  ?book
    blt:publication ?publication;
    bibo:isbn10 ?isbn;
    dct:creator ?creator;
    dct:title ?title.
}</code></pre>

#### Books set in a location

A notable point about getting books set in a location is that location is typically formatted like 'Gloucester (England)'. So some manipulation of the address data has to be done to combine city and state.

<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><code>PREFIX bibo: &lt;http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/&gt;
PREFIX blt: &lt;http://www.bl.uk/schemas/bibliographic/blterms#&gt;
PREFIX dct: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/terms/&gt;
PREFIX event: &lt;http://purl.org/NET/c4dm/event.owl#&gt;
PREFIX foaf: &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/&gt;
PREFIX rdf: &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&gt;
PREFIX rdfs: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#&gt;
PREFIX c4dm: &lt;http://purl.org/NET/c4dm/event.owl#&gt;
SELECT ?book ?title ?isbn ?creator ?name WHERE {
  ?setIn rdfs:label "Gloucester (England)" .
    ?publication event:place ?place;
    c4dm:time ?time.
  ?book
    a bibo:Book;
    blt:bnb ?bnb;blt:publication ?publication;
      ibo:isbn10 ?isbn;
      dct:title ?title;
      dct:creator ?creator;
      dct:spatial ?setIn.
    ?creator foaf:name ?name.
}</code></pre>

#### Display the data

The easiest way to display the data within a Pebble.JS app is just to update the home card values (title, subtitle, body text) with whatever data has been found.

<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><code>function displayItem(title, subtitle, body){
  main.title(title);
  main.subtitle(subtitle);
  main.body(body);
}</code></pre>

And that's it.
