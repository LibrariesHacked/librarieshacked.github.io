I've been a strong advocate for open data over the past decade or so. This started out with library data: the frustration of trying to create a basic library finder but discovering there was no public data to support it. 

It moved into a more professional role. Working in a local council to release lots of open data, I saw how it transformed insight into local public services, and became hugely influential in how a local authority could operate.

At a wider level, once you start to appreciate open data you see how it is essential it is in day-to-day life. For example, our current transport infrastructure would be dysfunctional (or at least more dysfunctional than it is) without open data.

Being passionate about library services, it makes perfect sense to also be passionate about open data. It's easy to look at public library services and see how a lack of data, and specifically open data, is holding back the sector. In almost every single project, local or national, big and small, technical or non-technical, the lack of open data is a barrier to progress, insight, and making the most of that project.

Sometimes it appears there is an antagonistic attitude to open data, or at least a strong mistrust from within the sector. This is a problem, but is something that will disappear with time as general attitudes change and roles change. But the wider problem is a lethargy and a lack of deeper understanding. The overriding attitude is that sure, open data would be good (yay for transparency!), but we're pretty busy at the moment, and don't really have the time to think about it.

This is where I think the role of the open data advocacy is so important. It's not about trying to convince people that open data is just good, it's about trying to explain that libraries can't operate effectively without it, and aren't at the moment. That's not being overly critical, there are other major issues that are holding back the sector: funding, staffing, training. But open data is one that is actually relatively cheap to fix. Not doing it is the equivalent of someone offering to double the library funds but saying "go away please, I don't really have the time to think about that right now".
