I'm publishing this shortly before an event that looks great. The British Library's Living Knowledge Network is running a [public libraries and climate change event](https://register.gotowebinar.com/register/8783941637588292366), looking at how libraries can tackle climate change.

I imagine there's huge potential in this. Opportunities for educating the population, highlighting information on climate change, and providing resources where appropriate. All the things we know are done well by libraries. 

But I've been interested in a while in maybe smaller things: libraries looking at their own individual carbon footprint and impact on the environment. And of course as it's the focus of this blog, how open data can be at the centre of that. 

### Digital waste

Every now and then I send an email and copy in multiple people. And if I add just one more person that's free, right? No it's not. It has a cost to the environment in the same way as any physical energy usage. How about adding an attachment? No! It'll send out loads of copies of that file.

I'll start with a book recommendation. Check out [World Wide Waste by Gerry McGovern](https://gerrymcgovern.com/world-wide-waste/).

> Digital is physical. Digital is not green. Digital costs the Earth. Every time I download an email I contribute to global warming. Every time I tweet, do a search, check a webpage, I create pollution. Digital is physical. Those data centers are not in the Cloud. They’re on land in massive physical buildings packed full of computers hungry for energy.

Of course this is all true, but we rarely consider such things. Walk rather than drive? Yes, that's often said. Turn off the lights, or turn the thermostat down a little? Yep. But limit the number of recipients you send an email to? No-one says it. Or if they do it's just cos they don't wanna be sent emails.

How could digital waste apply to library activities?

* Delete stuff! Those 'do not print this email' messages should change to 'delete this as soon as possible'
* Reduce the audience and frequency of marketing emails
* Appreciate that more views on social media is worse for the environment. Try to reduce how many people see your latest video, but increase useful and relevant engagement.
* Store data and information efficiently - do you have multiple copies of documents? Could you store everything in one place and email links to it?

### Building energy usage

Libraries use lots of energy. Those big old buildings need lots of light, heat and power.

In 2017 I was working for Bath and North East Somerset Council, and releasing lots of open data. At some point I was alerted to an energy database which held half-hourly gas and electricity readings for all the meters across the council. That included all the buildings (including schools and libraries), and even smaller places like car parks.

So, we set up a script to release that data on a daily basis for anybody to explore.

You might think a Council and schools are already looking at their energy use in detail. In reality, probably one or two people across a local authority may be. Schools certainly won't have a dedicated energy manager.

From opening up that data things moved quickly.

1. The community group Bath Hacked ran a hackathon called [We love the Environment](https://www.bathhacked.org/bath-hacked-loves-the-environment/what-did-we-build/), which invited people to explore how to use data and digital technology for the good of the local environment
2. A project called School Power applied their knowledge of that data to council buildings, including Bath Central Library. The [analysis of the electricity consumption of council buildings in Bath](http://transitionbath.org/analysis-electricity-consumption-council-buildings-bath/) included suggestions of saving £230,000 over 10 years in the Central Library (as well as the associated climate benefit).
3. That project went on to become funded by the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) and OVO Foundation. The [Energy Sparks project](https://energysparks.uk/) now helps many schools become more energy efficient and fight climate change

All through local endeavour and a bit of open data.

So libraries, release all your energy usage data. Get your local authority to do this for all buildings. Engage local people with this data.

### Website footprint

This blog should not be here. It's likely costing more to the environment than any possible benefit from you reading this post.

In my defence this website is pretty lightweight. But what about library websites?

1. Take your main library catalogue website and enter the address into [Website Carbon Calculator | How is your website impacting the planet?](https://www.websitecarbon.com/). How does it do? What do you need to do to make up for that impact?
2. Ensure you check out [17 ways to make your website more energy efficient](https://www.wholegraindigital.com/blog/website-energy-efficiency/)
3. Think about turning your website off sometimes! Is that impossible? What about things like Intranets and other internal sites?

### Travel optimisation

There are a few aspects of travel I'm interested in that are relevant to libraries.

* **Commuting.** Libraries and public sector organisations should be leading by example on working remotely, where roles allow for this. That doesn't necessarily mean working from home: many people don't have the space or the wish to do this. But explore ways in which you can offer employees the choice of working from the most efficient location for them and the environment. Perhaps pay for co-working spaces, or create them in your libraries.
* **Mobile libraries.** I wrote more about [mobile library routing](https://blog.librarydata.uk/mobile-library-data-routes/) as part of a wider project on mobile library data. But mobile libraries are driving around without decent route optimisation, and little collaboration between services. With some standard data and applications we could look at route optimisation across the UK to drive fuel efficiency.
* **Book distribution.** I loved working for Libraries West, a consortium in the South West that fully share a catalogue. That shared catalogue means that books travel around a lot. See [Most travelled books - Thoughts from the Systems Team](https://librarieswest.github.io/most-travelled-books) for an analysis showing that one item had travelled at least 1214 miles just when transferring between libraries. What could be done with data on how books move around? They are often returned by default to their home library - should that happen? Why not leave them wherever they end up?

### Library locations

Should people travel to libraries, or should libraries travel to people? A mobile library seems like a gas-guzzler but in reality moving a library around to where people are located may be better than people travelling to libraries.

A little while ago I looked at [Libraries on the high street](https://blog.librarydata.uk/libraries-on-the-high-street/) - an analysis of library locations and whether they are really commonly found on 'high streets'. They often are, but also frequently a little away from high streets. But where else should they be? If retail park use is higher than it used to be then shouldn't libraries be there as well?

Maybe in rethinking changing use of high streets we need to rethink where libraries are located for most efficient access. That will include a mix of static and mobile.
