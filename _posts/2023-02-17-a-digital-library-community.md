In December I ran a survey to find out what people would want from a digital library community.

The introduction ran as follows:

> This is an anonymous survey to gauge interest in forming a community of library digital, technology, and data practitioners.
>
> Anyone involved or interested in libraries and digital/technology developments would be welcome, regardless of how you perceive your level of expertise. This would include library staff at all levels and sectors, suppliers and other interested organisations, and library users.
> 
> Any group would be community-led, and independent of individual organisations.

Firstly, many thanks to everyone who took the time to fill out the survey. And also who shared it, on Twitter and LinkedIn. Particular thanks to [Artefacto](https://www.artefacto.org.uk) for doing this, as well as giving essential feedback and guidance on the survey.

What are my reference points for the kind of community or events that could be possible?

In 2017 and 2019 Claire Back, Aude Charillon, and I, organised a couple of 'Library data unconferences' - Voyage of the Data Treader 1 and 2. These followed a traditional unconference format (attendees pitching ideas for sessions), and the sessions were about all things library data. But we also arranged more formal training sessions by invited speakers, such as Owen Stevens who presented on using OpenRefine, and Jason Evans who gave an introduction to using Wikidata. There are plenty of things that could be improved about those events, but they didn't lack enthusiasm from the attendees, and it was great to see staff from many different areas keen to share ideas and learn from each other.

I've attended and presented at tech meetup groups, where a regular event is held and a speaker volunteers or is asked to present on a topic. These are great to learn about new things, and for networking with other people. For the volunteer speakers they are good opportunities to practice their presentation skills, and get feedback on their ideas within a friendly environment.

I've also always been impressed by events like [Library Camp](http://www.librarycamp.co.uk/), which were unconferences for library staff without specifically being about data. Follow up [Failcamp](https://www.artefacto.org.uk/failcamp-librarycamp-and-the-power-of-unconferences/) events were also great for sharing failures and learning from them.

I've helped run 'hackathons' within a community interested in local data (e.g. air quality, accessibility of venues, environmental health). These are longer events where people come together to work on a project or idea. These are great for getting away from the day job and working with new people to try something out.

There are a huge variety of types of event or group. There are library networks like [the JiscMail] lists(https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/mailinglists/a-z/index.html) which are great for sharing information and asking questions. But I'm not sure if they are the right place for informal discussions and sharing of ideas. There are also communities like the [Libraries Connected Innovation network](https://www.librariesconnected.org.uk/training-and-events/innovation-gathering-2023) but that's more of a closed community specifically for public library staff.

So, what would people want? Here are the results from the survey.



## Do you feel there is a need for a cross-sector community to discuss technology and digital developments within libraries?

| Yes | No |
| --- | -- |
| 97% | 3% |

Surely the people filling out a survey on a digital library community would be interested in such a community?

An odd question perhaps, but it felt like it was checking whether the premise was correct to start with. The results seem to bear out that need, for the majority of respondents.


## Would you be interested in being part of any of the following (choose as many as apply)


| Option | Response |
| --- | -- |
| An online community such as a forum, or chat platform | |
| A regular meetup group that run short sessions (e.g 1-2 hours) | |
| A conference with pre-arranged speakers and topics |  |
| An unconference where attendees propose and choose discussions at the event | |
| A training event that provided workshops and hands on materials | |


By far the most popular. I imagine that's due to universal appeal and access. Physical events certainly can have access problems, with geography, work, and other barriers for many people.


None of the options were particularly unpopular. 


## Which of the following topics would you be most interested in (choose as many as apply)



| Option | Response |

Library websites and online catalogues

Digital transformation

User experience (UX)

Web development

Library management systems

Accessibility

Data (e.g. Analysis, Big data, Data ethics)

Open knowledge (Open source, Open data, Open access)

Digital marketing

Library metadata

Hardware (e.g. kiosks, 3D printers, RFID)

There was an 'Other' option. Responses to this included:



If attending an event or meetup would you prefer that it were in-person, online, or hybrid (a mix of both)
