Wouldn't it be good  if we had a map of the UK where you could choose any area (at significant precision) and see how many library members there were, what percentage of the population that was, and view details of the area. It would show what libraries the people in the area used

You need data to do stuff with. Libraries need stuff to see before they'll do data.

So, what's the answer? Initially, make up the data and do stuff with it.

So, how about building a detailed library membership dashboard with fake data?

What are the stages:

1. Create a data schema for open data on library membership 
2. Generate (fake) the data that libraries that would be esy for libraries to create for themselves
3. Show how this data could be validated and converted into the open data format
4. Find data sources that the data could be merged with
5. Create a dhasboard to display and use the data
