Data-Driven Decisions: A Practical Toolkit for Library and Information Professionals is available from [Facet Publishing](https://www.facetpublishing.co.uk/title.php?id=9781783309799) and other bookshops. I was kindly given a temporary review copy by the publisher, but as this took so long to write, I also bought an ebook copy.

Firstly, this isn't a proper review. After recent thinking about it I didn't feel that was something I wanted to describe it as. The book is good and worth buying, so do so if you can, or encourage your organisation to do so! Here are some thoughts on the content, some of which is critical, but purely as personal preference.

### Introduction

> Whatever your reason for picking up this tome today, I hope it allows you to love and use data a little bit more than you did before.

The introducton gives a comforting background to the author's history, and makes it particularly accessible to those from a non-data background. You don't need to be good at maths, or even to have ever enjoyed maths, to be able to use data. You don't need to love data (yet), but hopefully you will by the end of the book.

This seems particularly important in the library sector, at least from my experience. People who are very good at their jobs, but who are not confident in their data skills are often given the task of managing data. This can be a destructive situation, where they are left to figure it out for themselves, as well as given fairly dull data tasks. That doesn't create a scenario in which they can begin to love data, which is really just being able to love libraries. If you are in any way curious about the operations of your library, or the people who use it, then data is a way to explore those things.

The introduction is also effective in tying the (better) use of data to the challenges library services are facing and advocating for data in tackling these problems.

The book feels very jargon-free, and in a genuine way, rather than self-consciously trying to remove jargon. Perhaps because the author has learned the techniques and methods through experience rather than formal training.

A minor quibble: I'd love for library services in using data in better ways to prkmote 'data-informed' decisions. It's a minor distinction from data-driven but more accurately represents that decisions should be made by people, informed by data.

### The toolkit

The toolkit takes the form of six steps, each presented as chapters. These are Identify, Collect, Map, Analyse, Act, and Review. This is pretty similar to other guides you'll find and is a good structure to follow to do targeted data analysis, and performance analysis. They're also well covered, with plenty of good examples, and with the same jargon-free approach.

There are some aspects of the guidance in the toolkit where it feels like bad practice, or at least practice that that could lead to bad habits. There is repeated guidance to effectively 'save as you go' and store data at its different states to potentially reuse later.

> Well, while it's not wrong that you could pull the data you need again at a later date, when you start 

I'd take an alternate view on this. Rarely save data, and when you do delete it as soon as possible. The key is not to store data as you go, that creates duplicate copies of the underlying source data and always leads to trouble in terms of data retention and archive policies, as well as just being bad for data storage and carbon footprint.

I'm sure it's not the practice of the author to be inefficient with data storage but I'd even go as far to stress that you should prioritise deleting data as you go over saving data. I've seen library services routinely saving data extracts onto shared drives, where that data is already stored and backed up in the main library management system (yes, including personal data). They've then created their own backups of that data (the shared drives are already backed up), which are then also backed up by IT processes. The exponential growth of data storage becomes horrific.

On the point about redoing things you've done in the past, this is I'd suggest saving your steps as you go, but not data. For example, maybe that is an Excel formula you used, or even an Excel spreadsheet which has the fomulas you need but not the data. If there are 10 steps to go from the data source into a format then you want to save those steps to make that process repeatable, not the 10 copies of the data at each stage.

What about the overall approach (identify, collect, map, analyse, act, review)? I think they are good fpor the majority of the time, and likely most data work people will do.

I personally don't know if those linear steps are as useful as they once were. I'd like us to develop a more holistic approach to data stewardship, management, and analysis that looks into what data is being held, minimising that as much as possble, and steps for generating dynamic insight from it.

Recent organisations I've worked with that are advanced in data analysis think less about identifying what they need to collect. Collection is really the data you already hold (accumulate), primarily through operational need. And if you don't have an operational need to hold that data then you probably don't need to collect it.

I appareciate this is likely to be beyond the power of the majority of library staff. The library management syystem should be seen as the data storage 

But minor quibbles, and in many ways personal preference. It's neither a self-proclaimed 'best-practice' book or a data science manual, it's one expert in the field sharing their experience and knowledge and techniques they have built up over time.

### Other approaches

It's all very well to bang on about other approaches, but this book then goes and expplores lots of those, with guest authors tackling various
