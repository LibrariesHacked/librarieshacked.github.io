Since late last year (with a pause due to the global pandemic) a working group, organised via the DCMS have been working on formal defintions for a core public library data schema. There is more introduction on that in the following blog posts.

There are currently 7 datasets that have been trialled. My own personal favourite is that of [library membership](https://schema.librarydata.uk/membership). This is a pretty core dataset held by all public libraries: people who are using the service. But it has it's problems and discussion points. How long do people remain members after not using the service? In my bedside drawer I have a collection of library cards and like to think of myself as a member of all of them. But I'm probably not, I'll be long since deleted.

Also, what aspetcs of library usage require membership? Surely not going in and reading the paper? Though actually I've heard in some services papers are checked out in the same way as books are. Do they also ask for a meberhsip card, and if so how many extra members does that get them?

Library data collected for CIPFA reports defines 'borrowers', and has a very specific definition:

> An active borrower is defined as someone who has borrowed at least one item from the library during the year. This figure should come from th elibrary management system and relate to borrowing and not membership figures.

CIPFA can be as specific as they like, but the data isn't. Some systems don't work that way. A system may treat active members as those who have logged into a PC, paid a fine, used an e-resource. I remember querying with a library supplier what all the other services did to meet the strict CIPFA definition. "They don't" was the concise answer, and neither the supplier nor the library services seemed to care. And fair enough, life's too short.

I think the biggest lesson here was that whatever data we want, it's not necessarily the data we're going to get. Therefore the schema and definitions need to reflect that. Having a very strict definition that isn't enforced or even possible will just cause an illusion that all the data is the same. For better to have a broad definition and understand the problems.

What we found was that, particularly since GDPR, services are maintaining their membership databases to remove members who they don't consider active. It would be great for all library services to have exactly the same policies around this, but that's unlikely, particularly with those that have debt collection policies. However, asking services to publish a summary of the users in the membership database is enough to produce useful data. If the membership counts are higher than the population, clearly something is wrong in that database!

Anyway, library membership data is a geekfest.

### Geography

One aspect of library membership that is rarely looked at, aside from quite specific times in a library service's history (e.g. consultation), is where library members are from.

A count of members would at least tell us what percentage of that local authority's population are library members surely? No. 

Again, looking at CIPFA, library services report a count of borrowers. And from that count CIPFA explicitly report a membership 


When trialling the data we saw Plymouth membership data. In that, it looked like 10% were from other local authorities. The obvious ones you'd expect: Cornwall, Hampshire, Devon. But also Bristol, Wiltshire, and Surrey. OK, well 10% from outside the auhthority, that's not much. Well, how about other services? In places like Bath and Bristol this is closer to 15%. In other areas it may be significant;y more. We don't know until more authorities start looking.

None of this denies the trends of CIPFA data, we pretty much all know those. But it certainly denies the operational usability of the data as being something for the service to delve into deeply, or look at for insight.


## Deprivation

Do the two maps follow a particular pattern? Yes, they show, fairly clearly a correlation between.

With this data, maintained across library services, we can get huge
