**Data-Driven Decisions: A Practical Toolkit for Library and Information Professionals**, written by Amy Stubbing, is [available from Facet Publishing](https://www.facetpublishing.co.uk/page/detail/data-driven-decisions/?k=9781783304783), and all good bookshops (maybe call ahead). I was kindly given access to a temporary review copy by the publisher, and also bought an ebook copy.

Firstly 'review' isn't something I'd like to describe this post as. The book is good and worth buying, so do so if you can, or encourage your organisation to do so. Here are some thoughts on the content, some of which is critical, but mainly from personal preferences.

### Introduction

The introducton makes the book feel particularly accessible to those from a non-data background. You don't need to be good at maths, or even to enjoy it, to be able to use data. You don't need to love data, but hopefully you will by the end of the book.

This seems particularly important in the library sector, at least from my experience. People who are very good at their jobs, but not confident in their data skills are often given the task of managing data. This can be a destructive situation, where they are left to figure it out for themselves, as well as being given fairly dull tasks. That doesn't create a situation in which they can begin to love data. Which is a shame. If you are in any way curious about the operations of your library, and the people who use it, then data is a way to explore those things - loving library data is about loving libraries.

The introduction is also powerful in tying the better use of data to the challenges library services are facing in the future, and advocating for data in tackling these problems.

The book is very jargon-free, and in a genuine way, rather than trying to remove or explain jargon. Perhaps because the author has learned the techniques and methods through experience rather than formal training, and so the language comes naturally.

I dislike the term 'data-driven', though I'm sure few people are completely driven by data over other factors. But I'd love for library services to promote 'data-informed' decisions as an alternative phrase to 'data-driven'. It's a minor distinction but represents that decisions should be made by people, informed by data.

### The toolkit

The toolkit takes the form of six steps, each presented as chapters: Identify, Collect, Map, Analyse, Act, and Review. This is pretty similar to other guides you'll find and is a good structure to follow to do targeted data and performance analysis. They're also well covered, with plenty of good examples, and with the same conversational style.

There are some aspects of the guidance in the toolkit where it feels like bad practice, or at least practice that that could lead to bad habits. There is repeated guidance to 'save as you go', and store data at its different states to potentially reuse later.

I'd take an alternate view on this. Creating duplicate copies of underlying source data leads to trouble in terms of data retention and archive policies, as well as just being bad for data storage and carbon footprint.

I'm sure it's not the practice of the author to be inefficient with data but I'd even go as far to stress that you should prioritise deleting data over saving data. I've seen library services routinely saving data extracts onto shared drives (including personal data), where that data is already held and backed up in the main Library Management System. They've then created their own additional backups of that data (despite the shared drives already having backup schedules), which are then again backed up by IT processes. The exponential growth of data storage requirements becomes horrific.

On the point about re-doing things you've done in the past, this is where I'd suggest saving your steps as you go, but not data. For example, maybe that would be an Excel formula you used and could be saved in a template. If there are 10 steps to convert the data from source then you want to save those steps to make that process repeatable, not the 10 copies of the data at each stage.

Anyway, what about the overall approach (identify, collect, map, analyse, act, review)? I think it's reliable and useful for the majority of the time, and likely most useful for what people need in general. And the fact there are so many practical examples, they are undoubtedly going to be relevant to the exact things people reading the book will be doing.

I personally don't know if those linear steps are as useful as they once were. I'd like us to develop a single approach to data systems, management, stewardship, and analysis that looks into what data is being held, minimising that as much as possble, and steps for generating dynamic insight from that data.

Recent organisations I've worked with that are advanced in data analysis think less about identifying what they need to collect. Collection is the data you already accumulate, primarily through day to day operations. And if you don't have an operational need to hold that data then you probably shouldn't have it.

I appreciate this is likely to be beyond the power of the majority of library staff, where the Library Management System is a primary data source, but not something that they have a great deal of control over to actually manage the data.

### Other approaches

It's all very well for me to bang on about other approaches, but the book also explores lots of these, with guest authors tackling various subjects: moving from transactional to a transformational service, collection mapping, user experience and qualitative data, alternative data sources (like social media), building a data culture, and data visualisation.

All of these are great. They keep up the same tone, which is impressive given the variety of authors. I particularly enjoyed the collection mapping section, which showed (among many other things) how important sharing open data between libraries is in assessing a collection.

These additional sections are really interesting, but to some extent are both too brief and in too much detail. They go a bit further than an overview but not enough for a great deal of practical use. The digital and social media chapter for example includes social media data, sentiment analysis, altmetrics, web analytics. This is easily enough for a book - you could have a book (and there are probably many) on just web analytics.

But still, go and get it.
