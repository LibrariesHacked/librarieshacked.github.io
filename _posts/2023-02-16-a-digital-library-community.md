In December/January I ran survey to find out what people may want from a digital library community.

The introduction ran as follows:

> This is an anonymous survey to gauge interest in forming a community of library digital, technology, and data practitioners.
>
> Anyone involved or interested in libraries and digital/technology developments would be welcome, regardless of how you perceive your level of expertise. This would include library staff at all levels and sectors, suppliers and other interested organisations, and library users.
> 
> Any group would be community-led, and independent of individual organisations.

Firstly, many thanks to everyone who took the time to fill out the survey. And also who shared the survey with others, on Twitter and LinkedIn. Particular thanks to [Artefacto](https://www.artefacto.co.uk/) for doing this, as well as giving essential feedback and guidance on the survey.

What are my reference points for the kind of community or events that could be possible?

In 2017 and 2019 Claire Back, Aude Charillon, and I, organised a couple of 'Library data unconferences' - Voyage of the Data Treader 1 and 2. These followed a traditional 'unconference' format (the attendees pitch ideas for sessions), and the sessions were about all things library data. But in addition to that there were more formal training sessions by invited speakers, such as Owen Stevens who presented on using OpenRefine, and Jason Evans who gave ann introduction to using Wikidata. There are many things that could be improved about theose events, but they didn't lack enthusiasm from the attendees, and it was great to see library staff from many different areas keen to share ideas and learn from each other.

I've been involved in the past in tech meetup groups where a regular event is held and a speaker is invited to present on a topic. These are great for learning about new things, and also for networking with other people in the same area. Also for the volunteer speakers they are a great way to practice their presentation skills, and to get feedback on their ideas within a friendly environment.

I've also always been impressed by events like [Library Camp](http://www.librarycamp.co.uk/), which were unconfernces for library staff without specifically being about data. Follow up [FailCamp](https://failcamp.org.uk/) events were also great for sharing failures and learning from them.

I've also been involved in organising a 'hackathons' within a community interested in local data (e.g. air quality, accessibility of venues, ironmental health). These are longer events where people come together to work on a project or idea. These are great for getting away from the day job and working with new people to explore ideas.

There are a huge variety of . I know there are library networks like [JiscMail](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/) and [LIS-UK](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=LIS-UK) which are great for sharing information and asking questions. But I'm not sure if they are the right place for more informal discussions and sharing of ideas. There are also communities like the [library innovators network](https://www.libraryinnovators.org/) 



## Do you feel there is a need for a cross-sector community to discuss technology and digital developments within libraries?

| Yes | No |
| --- | -- |
| 97% | 3% |

Surely the people filling out a survey on what they may want from a digital library community would be interested in such a community?

An odd question, but I suppose it felt like it was affirming whether the premise was correct to start with. The results seem to bear out that need, at least for the respondents.




## Would you be interested in being part of any of the following (choose as many as apply)


| Option | Response |
| --- | -- |
| An online community such as a forum, or chat platform | |
| A regular meetup group that run short sessions (e.g 1-2 hours) | |
| A conference with pre-arranged speakers and topics |  |
| An unconference where attendees propose and choose discussions at the event | |
| A training event that provided workshops and hands on materials | |


By far the most popular. I imagine that's due to universal appeal and access. Physical events certainly can have access problems, with geography, work, and other barriers for many people.


None of the options were particularly unpopular. 


## Which of the following topics would you be most interested in (choose as many as apply)



| Option | Response |

Library websites and online catalogues

Digital transformation

User experience (UX)

Web development

Library management systems

Accessibility

Data (e.g. Analysis, Big data, Data ethics)

Open knowledge (Open source, Open data, Open access)

Digital marketing

Library metadata

Hardware (e.g. kiosks, 3D printers, RFID)

There was an 'Other' option. Responses to this included:



If attending an event or meetup would you prefer that it were in-person, online, or hybrid (a mix of both)
