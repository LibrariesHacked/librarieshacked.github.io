Data has always been an essential, and neglected, part of UK public library services. This has become particularly clear since the Covid-19 pandemic.

To consider this, it is worth considering events of the past few months and highlight what data, or skills and training, have particularly been missing.

### Before lockdown

Before official UK lockdown there were library services closing some libraries, leaving others open, adjusting opening hours, and generally . In one case in Barnet the libraries were only closed when the staff voted to walk out.

The situation highlighted that on a national level, there is no means of keeping track of library services and what they are doing.

The fabulous Public Libraries News website offered a comprehensive list of what library services were doing, [Coronavirus and public libraries â€“ state of play 23 March](https://www.publiclibrariesnews.com/about-public-libraries-news/coronavirus-and-public-libraries). This was updated until the official announcement that all libraries should close.

**Missing data**: A list of public libraries, opening hours, and services offered. With the ability to keep up to date and record reasons for emergency closures.


## During lockdown



Library services





### National coordination


At the beginning of the lockdown it became clear that there were loads of online activities being adopted, or enhanced, by library services. The key question was for some of the National library 

- Libraries Connected 'Libraries from home' pages https://www.librariesconnected.org.uk/page/librariesfromhome on their website. This brings together resources

- CILIP

- Public Libraries News

The Libraries connected pages are excellent. As I write this, the pages are describing an event:

>> "Join author T.M. Logan tonight at 6.30pm for Greater Manchester Libraries Twitter book chat".

So if that's 'tonight' then presumably that content has been added today, and will likely also be removed tonight. By someone logging in to the website and updating the text.

One primary thing to take from that is to praise the dedication that underpins public servies and library services. From the point of view of something sustainable, it's notpossible to sustain that longer than an emergency situation.

And it leads you to think 'why did it need to come to this?' Where someone has to manually update web pages to highlight library events. Never before has public libraries' poor data infrastructure been exposed so clearly. It's not good enough, and it's failed us at the worst time.


#### Analysing data

Another feature of the rise of library online services has ben the conflicting information on adoption of these services. The following are all things that have been reported, mainly coming from a few figures, reported in various ways by different media outlets (note: all relate to England rather than the UK).

- "120,000 people joined libraries in the three weeks after lockdown began". [Libraries see surge in e-book borrowing during lockdown](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-52368191), BBC, 24th May 2020
- "Weekly digital loans from libraries across England doubled in the three weeks after they were closed on 23 March". [Libraries see surge in e-book borrowing during lockdown](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-52368191), BBC, 24th May 2020
- "More than 120,000 people joined local libraries across England after 23 March to use libraries' digital services, which is up more than 600% on last year"


The lack of context in the article to explain these figures is a problem. But data can be used to answer questions, so here are a few.

### Did library membership increase more during lockdown compared to a year ago?

Going by the above articles, yes. 120,000 new members, an increase on the previous year signups by 600%. The Bookseller article actually suggests overall membership is up 600%, wich will be wildly incorrect.

But in reality, the numbers of new members will likely be down. There isn't such data available for England, for signups to library services. Many library services themselves would not currently be able to say how many new members they had within those three weeks compared to the year before.


Overall, library membership is also likely to be considerably down. Libraries will consider membership based upon relatively recent usage of the service (e.g. active in the past year or two years). More commonly members not active in this time will be removed from library systems. The longer the lockdown goes on, the greater the decrease in membership. 

This is unavoidable but will be a key consideration for . In theory it shouldn't really matter. People not able to use the library 

### Has ebook/eaudio/emagazine use increased?

Yes, despite so many figures flying round, plenty of reports are coming in that these have increased.


Possibly more importantly, is have these numbers increased in line with the increase in membership of online services? And have they increased in line with comparable retail reports of [increase in reading during lockdown]().




### The future

What lessons have been learnt by those early pre-lockdown days when library services were struggling to decide what to do? Presumably, there is now an open spreadsheet of data showing all library services (or even each library), what the plans are for reopening. In this way it will be possible to easily compare experiences. Library services and the public will have somewhere to look 

Well, no. For Public Libraries News has started a new page showing [When and how will public libraries reopen in England](https://www.publiclibrariesnews.com/about-public-libraries-news/coronavirus-public-library-ideas-and-responses/when-and-how-will-public-libraries-reopen-in-england). Again, an essential and brilliant services, but after 3 months there was no National capability to do something that all library services could add to.

But we aready knew we needed data on libraries and library services, what else do we need?
