The current pandemic crisis has led to some emergency work.

- Libraries Connected 'Libraries from home' pages https://www.librariesconnected.org.uk/page/librariesfromhome on their website. This brings together resources

- CILIP have 



The Libraries connected pages are excellent. As I write this, the pages are describing an event:

>> "Join author T.M. Logan tonight at 6.30pm for Greater Manchester Libraries Twitter book chat".

So if that's 'tonight' then presumably that content has been added today, and will likely also be removed tonight. By someone logging in to the website and updating the text.

One primary thing to take from that is to praise the dedication that underpins public servies and library services. From the point of view of something sustainable, it's notpossible to sustain that longer than an emergency situation.

And it leads you to think 'why did it need to come to this?' Where someone has to manually update web pages to highlight library events. Never before has public libraries' poor data infrastructure been exposed so clearly. It's not good enough, and it's failed us at the worst time.

If data wasn't already at the top of the agenda for library service leaders then it needs to be.



### 

I want a website that I can go and see what remote virtual events are going on tonight. I even want it say 'tonight', as if someone has written that down.
