There's general recogni

Occasionally there will be opinion expressed that libraries could be selling data to bing income to the library service. his is understandable - library budgets are under pressure and service heads are desperate for income generation. 



### People see through income generation



### It's often hugely damaging





### It would limit audience and use of data

Assuming that there's a commercial market for public library data (there's not but let's go with it), 

The only real player in this area is CIPFA, who currently have an odd arrangement. Libraries could argue that they should be selling this data rather than giving it away for free, but the only market CIPFA resell to is really library services themselves. Even by getting the data free, CIPFA do nothing significant with it, make no significant money, and don't really have a business model that would allow them to do so.



### It would be better to become part of an essential data infrastructure

There are many data sources that are essential within UK related data analysis that are freely available. Things like the [indices of multiple deprivation](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-indices-of-deprivation-2019) . Plus all the datasets built and released by ONS and other government departments. These are all freely available and are used by many people and organisations.

Attempt to stop those organisations from doing their data work and there will be resistance. The data is part of the infrastructure that makes the UK society and govenrment work.


### It's against the point of libraries

Arguing that libraries should be selling data is little different to arguing that libraries should be selling books. The books held in public libraries belong to the public. The data held by public libraries also belongs to the public.

Like books, the library service is there to provide access to that data and information, not to withhold it. The only exceptions are in managing access to personal data, which is to comply with their legal duty as well as protect users.

### It isn't legal

It's generally a good idea for public services not to go down the route of illegal activity. 

Fortunately, for now at least UK law
