I was watching the British Library Labs symposium this month and was interested to see a quick update on the public libraries Single Digital Presence (SDP) work. Check out the video of the whole [library labs symposium on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCdakFvVYEc). It's all ace, but the SDP update is [2 hours into the streaming event](https://youtu.be/ZCdakFvVYEc?t=7216). 

The Bookseller also published a recent update from the team, [transforming the digital offer for public libraries](https://www.thebookseller.com/blogs/transforming-digital-offer-public-libraries-1220211), and research partners DXW have published a case study on [creating a national digital presence for public libraries](https://www.dxw.com/case-studies/creating-a-national-digital-presence-for-public-libraries/)

These all show that the project includes a wider focus on digital transformation, rather than only delivering a single software platform.

Having thought a little about digital transformation, and my experience of it, I think there are a number of things worth considering for public library digital services.

### Fix before building

I try to advocate for the [Local Digital Declaration](https://localdigital.gov.uk/declaration/), which many local government organisations have signed up to.

> We will ‘fix our plumbing’ to break our dependence on inflexible and expensive technology that doesn’t join up effectively
>
> **Local Digital Declaration**

This includes fixing the issues that cause problems and hamper projects. These could be related to data and software, but also culture and skills.

The recent Bookseller piece included a fairly reserved comment on the current state of library digital presences.

But what in particular is broken? Yes, the websites and services have poor usability, accessibility, and aren't pleasant to use. But those are symptoms, not underlying problems.

In November I was approached by a web developer. Enthusiastic about library services in their local area they wanted to create a new and accessible way of browsing the library catalogue (no, it wasn't me!). They had approached their library service, via freedom of information, for data on the titles in the catalogue. They'd requested this in spreadsheet format with data fields such as ISBN and stock level.

This isn't an odd request, and it should be a situation that we jump at the chance of fulfilling. People creating software for interacting with their library? Great, get them that data!

Unfortunately the library service replied that as there were over 1 million records it wouldn't be possible to provide the data within the £600 freedom of information limit. On appeal, the library service then insisted they were exempt from the request as the data was publicly searchable from the online catalogue.

It would be easy to be critical of the service. To say they were either overly protective of the data, or even intentionally obstructive. But I think they can be taken at face value. They likely don't have the required knowledge to do it, and unfortunately would have to go to a supplier, costing well over £600. But in this situation the member of the public is sent away disappointed with poor service from the library.

That's (partly) what is broken. The library cattalogue is the primary data held by a library management system, it should not be a problem to provide it on request. The problem is the skills and training for staff to be able to do it.

If there isn't enough investment in library system administration, what likelihood is there to be expertise in content design and user experience? These are essential skills for digital services.

There are hugely encouraging words from the British Library showing they fully appreciate this, and are looking at enabling library services. But there will only be so much they can be responsible for.

### Everyone needs to be engaged

Digital projects aren't delivered to organisations with immediate success. Whether it's an Intranet, a new Document Management System, or whatever. After implementation they need to be understood, adopted, and used effectively.

The tech industry can be guilty of solutionism by selling software as a single fix for a problem. Software can only ever be an effective tool, used by people. But on the other side, libraries can be guilty of buying software without considering the time and investment they will need to put in. The funding rarely goes that far. Whatever it costs to create and deliver, you will need a lot more after that.

It's all very well to demand 'where's the single digital presence?' But it is as relevant to ask library services what they have been doing to prepare for it. For all the work being done by the British Library to research and advise, far more will be needed from each library service to make it a success. Are services ready to undertake digital transformation?

### We need multiple digital presences

This isn't just being a smart arse about the term single digital presence. That clearly expresses the benefits of someone being able to go to one place to see information about multiple services, catalogues, resources, etc.

However, in the ideal situation we would have multiple digital presences. Or perhaps more accurately: multiple single digital presences. Want an app to quickly reserve library books? Sure, search the app store, look at the reviews, and choose one. What if the Reading Agency want to put a search for UK libraries on their website? Great, they should go for it. Delivery of those websites and apps is then out of the hands of library services.

True digital transformation will mean giving up control. The library website won't necessarily be the place people go to find out about their libraries. The library catalogue site won't be the place users reserve and renew their loans. They may choose the alternative site that allows them to tick the auto-renew option; that website will then handle renewing items for them.

### Work in the open

There is very little in the public library world that requires secrecy. The personal data of staff and the public being the primary exceptions, but little else.

Public organisations are quite locked down, often because they handle sensitive data. But as a result it can mean all information and data becomes locked down and fiercely guarded. That reduces understanding of data protection rather than enhancing it.

It's very hard to change this culture, but there are some great examples of working in the open. Check out [HackIT](https://hackit.org.uk/), the website of the technology, digital and data teams of Hackney Council. In it there are details of the projects they are working on, how they work, and service design principles. And most impressively, various [personal weeknotes](https://hackit.org.uk/how-we-work/weeknotes), which are the regular postings of what individuals have been doing.

And why not? It informs the public who may be interested, it will undoubtedly improve their own work, and it will also give them a greater understanding of where the open/private divide is in the data and information they handle.

### Don't reinvent the wheel

Working last year with library staff and the DCMS on the [library open data schemas](https://schema.librarydata.uk/) I was nervous that it must surely have all been done before. You know that comic about standards and constantly creating new ones? That was on my mind. As it was, for data schemas like public library membership, footfall, and issues, no, it hadn't been done. And hopefully that work can go on to be used in projects like the single digital presence.

</figure>

That principle of adopting standards, plus building upon past work is an important one. I recently rediscovered a blog post by Nick Poole about his learnings from being involved in 5 attempts to create a Single Digital Presence for libraries, called [building a successful online presence for libraries](https://nickpoole.org.uk/online-libraries/). This is essential reading for clear requirements for making a success of such a project (more so than this meandering one). 

But one thing it didn't delve into was how, if at all, those projects were linked. There is benefit in a 'failed' project if it gets the current situation further down the road. Have they done some groundwork of interoperability between systems, some standards for sharing data, or at least documented the work so it can be picked up the next time?

Other than thinking I know what a couple were, I don't have details of those 5 projects. But if they had been completed openly then more information would be available about them. As it is, it doesn't look like they were.
