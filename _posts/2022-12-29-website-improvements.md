The British Library's [LibraryOn](https://libraryon.org/) team ran [a survey on digital grants](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfoV6dqZvkDw94rqOHSl6J_oCHULu9ERvBd9XXGAyiCubykTA/viewform?fbzx=6567663660189811631) to get an idea of current digital needs. Details copied below:

> Next year we’ll be awarding 20-50 capital grants to public library services in England. We anticipate individual grants ranging from around £10,000 to £70,000, but this will be confirmed based on feedback. Details will be published in early 2023, with applications opening in the spring and activity to be completed by the end of next year.
>
> The grant programme complements the national development of the LibraryOn platform, and aims to improve the online presence of local libraries and increase digital capability. We envisage the grants being used on the implementation and testing of new digital products and services, or enhancing existing offers.

This is now closed. It asked for ideas about what services would use a digital grant for, and what they felt would be most useful for the library service.

It would be interesting to hear the ideas that people had for digital projects. In the spirit of proposing ideas, here are 5 on my wish list.

### 1. Mobile library notifications

If you follow mobile libraries on social media (as you should!) you'll know they often cancel services. Not mega often, but enough to be a problem. Mobile libraries are affected by weather, faults, and staffing issues.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We&#39;re really sorry but our Mobile Library can&#39;t stop at Wellow today. This is because the road conditions are too bad after the wet weather we&#39;ve had. <br>You can reserve or renew your books on LibrariesWest or call our friendly Council Connect team on 01225 394041.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BNESLibraries?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BNESLibraries</a> <a href="https://t.co/CCiFdhKvPI">pic.twitter.com/CCiFdhKvPI</a></p>&mdash; @Bath and North East Somerset Libraries (@BathnesL) <a href="https://twitter.com/BathnesL/status/1615302775306424321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 17, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

What happens when a mobile library can't fulfil a route or stop? Every effort is made to contact regular users directly, such as phoning them, and to renew their books. But there will still be people missed who don't use that service regularly. Phoning round customers for a set of stops requires time and effort, and isn't always possible. In some cases the library management system doesn't record that information, so manual lists of users per stop need to be maintained, a data protection issue in itself.

Often it's the mobile library driver that knows their customers, and will go the extra mile to contact them. But what if the regular driver is unavailable?

This is good digital transformation territory. Library services could set up a notification system that allows users to choose their preferred means of communication for when a stop, route, or mobile is cancelled. The notifications could be delivered via email, SMS, push notifications, phone call, or even voice assistant (e.g. Alexa). The library service could also set up a web page that would show the current status of mobile libraries, and the ability to subscribe to notifications.

### 2. An open public library catalogue API

Public library systems in the UK lack public APIs (application programming interfaces). These are a means for software developers to access the data and processes in a library catalogue, to use in their own applications. It's not that the library systems do not have APIs. They do - they're just proprietary and locked down.

It would be amazing if a library service could set up a public API to allow applications to do things like renew loans, check availability, and search the catalogue. Create the API, create public documentation for it, and promote it widely. Encourage people to trial new things. This could include:

- Creating new ways of browsing the catalogue
- An application to allow people to manage and auto-renew their loans
- People integrating their library activity with their social media (e.g. status notifications when you check out a book)
- Integration with voice assistants (e.g. "Alexa, when are my library books due for return?")

All things that would in general increase user choice, and promote library services.

### 3. Mobile library tracking

With recent snowy and icy weather I was reminded of the [Trunk Road Gritter Tracker](https://scotgov.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=2de764a9303848ffb9a4cac0bd0b1aab), a Scottish Government map of live locations of road gritters. It shows where they are, and also where they've been.

There's nothing difficult about this technology. Every time I get my local bus service I check the live map to see how it's doing (it's normally delayed leaving Bath), and can avoid leaving the house if it's not moving. I can leave the house when the bus is 3 minutes away, and avoid waiting ages in the freezing cold. That's good for me as I hate coats and refuse to wear one.

This isn't disimilar to the notification idea, but mobile libraries aren't going to go through an emergency notification process if they're just running 5 minutes late.

So let's have a map of mobile libraries moving around the UK, or at least a single service to start off with. It could also provide insight into:

- Potential additional stops that could be added to routes
- Inefficiencies in the route network
- Routes that collided with ones from other services which could be shared

### 4. Library branch information in catalogue results

Library branch information on websites is pretty good these days. You can often search for your nearest library by postcode, see them on a map, get opening times, and more.

This all unravels when you move to the library catalogue. You know your local library, when it's open, and how to get there. Well, the book you want isn't there - the catalogue says a different library has it, but no opening hours or how to get there. You could have it transferred, but that would cost and apparently take weeks, and you need it for Monday book group.

So back to the library search on the other library website. Except now the postcode search isn't useful, as you don't have a postcode to use. You need to match the name of the library to the one listed by the catalogue, but they seem to be named differently. Your library service shares a catalogue with loads of others, which is great, except you have no idea whether the library is 2 miles away, or 200.

All of this is due to the tiresome problem that the library catalogue is separate to the library website, and the two hate each other. But they're all just data and systems, there's no reason not to have a good user interface that combines the two.

I'd love to see a library service present detailed library branch information within catalogue results. If a book is due back in ten days but the library is closed for 4 days after that, it's not useful to show the due date for that copy. Users should see when the copy is next available in that branch, and that needs to use opening hours data.

### 5. Website carbon reduction

Across the small Libraries Hacked projects I've been implementing the [Website Carbon Calculator](https://www.websitecarbon.com/) badge, to measure each site's carbon footprint per visit. You should be able to see it on this blog.

Carbon counting has flaws in accuracy, but the principles are still sound. Digital energy usage is huge and increasing. Library websites (both information and catalogue) receive huge amounts of visitors, and are a significant part of the digital footprint of a library service. So why not measure it, and then try to reduce it?

If a service could measure the digital impact of their website and fund developments to reduce it, that could be a significant benefit. Given that many of those platforms (e.g. the catalogue) are on systems that many other services use, it could also hugely reduce the carbon footprint of the sector as a whole.

It would be a great example to present to the [#GreenLibraries conference](https://www.cilip.org.uk/events/EventDetails.aspx?id=1697993).
