The British Library's [LibraryOn]() programme have been [running a survey on digital grants](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfoV6dqZvkDw94rqOHSl6J_oCHULu9ERvBd9XXGAyiCubykTA/viewform?fbzx=6567663660189811631) to get an idea of current digital needs. Details copied below:

> Next year we’ll be awarding 20-50 capital grants to public library services in England. We anticipate individual grants ranging from around £10,000 to £70,000, but this will be confirmed based on feedback. Details will be published in early 2023, with applications opening in the spring and activity to be completed by the end of next year.
>
> The grant programme complements the national development of the LibraryOn platform, and aims to improve the online presence of local libraries and increase digital capability. We envisage the grants being used on the implementation and testing of new digital products and services, or enhancing existing offers.

The survey is very broad and asks for ideas about what services would use a digital grant for, and what they feel would be most useful for the library service. The implication though is that it should be in relation to the library's digital services and/or existing presence.

It would be interesting to hear the ideas people have for digital projects. In the spirit proposing ideas, here are a few on my wish list.

### Mobile library notifications

If you follow mobile libraries on social media (and you should) you will know they often cancel services. Not mega often, but enough to need special attention. Mobile libraries are more affected by weather, faults, and staffing issues than static libraries.

So what happens when a mobile library can't fulfil a route on a particular day? Or can't make a particular stop, due to something like flooding? Normally every effort is made to contact regular users directly, such as phoning them, and to renew their books. But what about the people who don't use that service regularly? Phoning round customers for a set of particular stops requires a lot of time and effort, and is not always possible. In some cases the library management system doesn't record that information, so separate manual lists need to be maintained, a serious data issue in itself.

Often it is the mobile library driver that knows their customers and will often go the extra mile to contact them. But what if they problem is that they're off?

This is good digital transformation territory. Library services could set up a notification system that would allow users to choose between various types of notitifications, when either a stop, route, or mobile was having trouble. The notifications could be delvered via email, SMS, push notifications, or assistant (e.g. Alexa). The library service could also set up a web page that would show the current status of mobile libraries, and the ability to subscribe to notifications.

### An open public library catalogue API

A missing aspect of public library systems in the UK is the lack of public API (application programming interface). This is a way for developers to access the data and processes in a library catalogue in order to use them in their own applications. That's not to say the library systems do not have APIs. They do, they're just proprietary and locked down for internal use only.

It would be amazing if a library service could set up a public API that would allow developers to do things like renew loans, check availability, and search the catalogue. Create the API, create public documentation for it, and promote it widely. Get people to trial things. They could try:

- Creating a new way of browsing the catalogue (e.g. maybe by published date timeline)
- Mobile applications for people to control auto-renewing their loans
- People integrating their library activity with social media (e.g. like Goodreads)
- Integration with voice assistants (e.g. 'Alexa, when are my library books due for return?')

### Mobile library tracking

With recent snowy and icy weather I was reminded of the [Trunk Road Gritter Tracker](https://scotgov.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=2de764a9303848ffb9a4cac0bd0b1aab), a map published by the Scottish Government that shows the live location of gritters on the road network. It shows where they are, and also where they've been so you can see where they've been gritting.

There's nothing overly difficult about the technology. Every time I get the bus I check the live map to see how it's doing (normally delayed leaving Bath), and can avoid leaving the house if it's not moving. I can leave the house when the bus is about 3 minutes away, and that avoids me waiting ages in the cold.



Not too disimilar to the notification idea, but mobile libraries aren't going to go through an emergency notificcation process if they're stck in traffic andsimpoy running 5 minites late.


### Library branch information in catalogue results

Branch listings on library websites are often pretty good these days. You can search for your nearest library, see them on maps, and get opening times.

This all unravels as soon as you actually start using the library catalogue. You can findyour local library, you know when it's open, and how to get there. Well, the book you want isn't there - you can the library it is in the catalogue, but you can't see the opening times or how to get there. You could have it transferred between libraries but that would cost money and apparently take 2 weeks.

So back to the library search on the library catalogue. Except now the postcode search isn't useful, you need to match the name of the library, from the branch listed in the catalogue, which is also named differently to the one on the website.
