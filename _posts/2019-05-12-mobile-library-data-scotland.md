It is too easy to make sweeping generalisations about mobile library information on public websites.

> Online mobile library timetables are appalling
- Libraries Hacked, 2019

This is generally true, but does need some evidence behind it.

Firstly, what makes good information on a website? For a mobile library you would expect to be able to find out basics such as where your nearest stop is, what day it is, the particular dates, and what time. 

All websites have an obligation for accessibility, and making sure the information is able to be consumed by everyone. This is especially the case for public sector websites, where people do not always have a choice as to whether they use it not. Not using the website would mean not being able to make use of public services.

New legislation came into affect in September 2018 for all public sector websites to meet a minimum accessibility standard. More details are available at the Gov.uk guidance [Make your public sector website or app accessible](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps).

Given it's a legal requirement, this seems to be a reasonable measure at which to assess mobile library timetables.

There are around 90 library service in the UK that operate a mobile library. It is hard to assess all these in one go, so this post will limit to the 22 in Scotland. This is not a substitute for a proper accessibility assessment, or real user testing. It simply gives an indication of the common problems around mobile library information.

The process for the assessment was to look through each mobile library website and record:

1. Is the information published as HTML? Guidance is that documents should primarily be available in HTML format as it provides much better options for assistive technologies.
2. Are the location of stops plotted on a map? This can aid in seeing where stops are, but online maps are often not very accessible. Because of this they are a type of content that can be exempt from being made accessible. That does not mean publc services can use online maps and not care about accessibility. It means they can use online maps but that they should also provide the map information in other ways.
3. Is the information published as a PDF? PDFs tend to be the most common format for mobile timetables, and aren't as good as HTML content. Measures can be taken to ensure PDFs are accessible though, and they could be used in addition to web content (e.g. for an easily printable format).
4. Does the website use colour for meaning? It is against accessibility to make use of colour to represent meaning when it is the only method for doing so. For example, colour-coding calendar dates to communicate which dates a mobile route is active on.
5. Is there any missing information? Sometimes basic information can be missing from online timetables. For example, the situation where a stop is described as 'week 1' or 'week 2' but not dates are given to work out then the library will arrive.
6. Does the website have an Accessibility Statement? This is a requirement of legislation. In reality the accessibility statement should be assessed for providing certain information, but in this instance I have just assessed whether any statement exists.
7. Any additional notes about the timetables.

A simple pass/fail was then given to the service based upon the following criteria

1. The information should be published as HTML
2. There should be no reliance on colour only
3. There must be no missing information
4. There must be an accessibility statement

The results are shown below.
