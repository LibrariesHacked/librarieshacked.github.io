## Public library web accessibility

In a post shortly after lockdown I looked at common problems with public library websites, after looking through all UK ones to compile information about library services. This is available at public library websites(https://blog.librarydata.uk/public-library-websites/)

One of the partiuclarly notable things was how inaccessible they were, and how necessary it was for libraries to make better web content, especially with services relying on the web to provide information for citizens,

### What is accessibility?

It has been a legal requirement to make service adjustments, including to websites, to ensure they can be used by any citizens. Legislation in 2018, the Act, goes further than this and specifies that public sector websites should be accessible to the Web Accessibility Group (WCAG) 2.1 'AA' standard. They must also publish a clear Accessibility statement on the website which gives details of how this standard has been achieved, and various other details. Comprehensive guidelinnes are available at 

A key aspect of accissibilty is clearly to not discriminate against those who have particular needs such as requiring use of a screen readers (tools that read out what is on the screen), who do not use a mouse, who are colour blind, and many more.

Probably the most common example I see, from commonly working in web development, is people asking me to create a link titled 'click here'. For many people it's simply a common thing they see on websites and makes complete sense. We use a mouse . But it makes so little sense when you consider that to click means nothing to those not using a mouse ((or even those using a touch interface). It also

Some of this didn't ring true. Local govenrment has better . if you join the LocalGov Digital Slack discussion group you will see a healthy and thirving community of web content practitioners discussing Accessibility issues and sharing practice on this,

Note, there is a particular exception to the general lack of interest in accessibility. Leeds libraries are clearly putting a lot of effort into this, and are doing their best to work with suppliers and look at their web presences to make these accessible.




### Do public libraries care?

OK, that's a bit of an emotive way of putting it. Do public libraries care about any of this. Well, no. This legislat

But that not caring isn't some callous disregard for those who are unable to access their services online, or not being interested in making their web presence better. But it's also not just being too busy, or not being able to do it.

Public libraries simply do not see themselves as 'digital' organisations. Mention web accessibility to a
