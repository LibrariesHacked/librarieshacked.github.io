## Public library web accessibility

An earlier post in this blog (available at [public library websites](https://blog.librarydata.uk/public-library-websites/)) looked at common problems with library websites.

One of these was how poor the websites were in terms of accessibility, and how important it was for libraries to make better web content. Especially with an increasing reliance on online services.

### What is web accessibility?

Equality legislation already mandates making adjustments to ensure services can be used by all citizens. But the Public Sector Bodies Accessibility Regulations 2018 go further for web accisibility. They specify that public sector websites should be accessible to a particular standard: 'AA' from the WCAG 2.1 standard(https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/understanding-wcag). They must also publish an Accessibility Statement which gives details of how this standard has been achieved, and detail any exemptions or plans to meet the standards.

Far more comprehensive guidelines for compliance are available at (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps)

A common example is web links with just the text 'click here'. This is probably something that people do because they;ve seen it often. It's an inaccessible pattern that is being reinforced by being so common. The link itself makes little sense when you consider that to 'click' is not relevant to those not using a mouse (or even those using a touch interface). And the word 'here' is only valid when actually looking at the link and web page. It makes assumptions about how the user is interacting with the page that aren't true of all users.

What if the content of the page is being read aloud? In that case the 'here' is not really valid. Links on web pages serve an important function of providing a way for people to navigate online, and it's important to make the link text useful. Maybe you have ten 'Click here' links on a webpage. Imagine trying to explain to someone what further pages they can go to, simply based upon the text of the links. "Well, you can go to 'click here', or 'click here', or 'click here'..". It's the equivalent of a fork in the road where a signpost has each direction with the text 'this way' written on it i.e. completely useless and a sure way of ensuring people get lost.

But it's an easy mistake to make, and there are many similar examples.

#### Have appropriate contrast between foreground text and background

You have a lovely high quality monitor, with particular contrast settings. But not everyone has the same eyesight, and even the same quality hardware. Ensuring a high contrast between text and background helps to read text.

#### Don't rely on people being able to recognise an image

Many people rely on screen readers to navigate and use websites. In that situation, images are of no use, as they cannot be 'read'.

A common mistake on library websites is to link to external resources by logo. Sometimes a series of logos with no text. To library staff, these are treasured and expensive eresources. To the public it's a meaningless series of images, with no explanation text about them.

  <figcaption>This series of links may look familiar but will mean nothing to those not looking aat the images, and are unlikely to even mean much to any member of the public</figcaption>

  <figcaption>There are so many issues with this way of providing access to Ancestry online. The mix of 'click here' links alongside being able to recognise the Ancestry logo - it should not have made it online!.</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Don't use colour as the only way of conveying meaning

Colour is great. But recognising colours shouldn't be necessary in interpreting information. That means trying to find different ways in graphs and diagrams to convey meaning. For mobile library timetables, this means stopping the common pattern of having a calendar with dates coloured in a certain way to indicate when a mobile library may be visiting.

  <figcaption>Mobile library timetables often use colour so to match a library route to when the library is visiting.</figcaption>

Good accessibility also about makes the web better for everyone. Content that is clear, well laid out, that uses plain language, descriptive links, good spacing around buttons, etc. All these things are welcome and make a site nice and easy to use. And that increases usage.

It's easy for the best websites to make mistakes. I'm not an accessibility expert, and there is ultimately no substitute than having good accessibility testing from users. By trying to follow accessibility guidelines, attempting to create good content, and publishing an accessibility statement shows that as an organisation you care about trying to make things better, and will correct mistakes.

### How are libraries doing?

Feedback from previous criticism of library webpages was that it essentially wasn't the library service. "Remember that libraries often don't have access to edit web content, sometimes there are strict controls from their parent council" was the gist of the argument.

And that's understanstandable, how can you make something better if you're not allowed near it? But this didn't ring true. Local government has some good digital practice. If you join the LocalGov Digital Slack discussion group you will see a healthy and thriving community of web content practitioners discussing accessibility issues. I was also noticing that it was the library websites most in line with their parent councils that were most likely to have good web content. It was content particularly on library catalogue sites, away from Council interference, that was particularly bad. Basically, the greater the library involvement, the worse things were.

To try to eliminate Council interference or control I looked again at library websites, but only those outside of the parent council. The test was simple, how many of these has an accessibility statement that would comply with the 2018 legislation?

Of 34, the number with compliant accessibility statemennts was two. Just over 5% legally compliant. One had an accessibility statement page that had been created in 2019, but then simply not been completed. Arguably this is worse than not having one, as it looks like they've decided to follow the legislation, but then not bothered. For users that particularly require accessible websites that may see that non-statement it looks like "up yours, love from your local library".

That's individual services, but what about the national leadership organisations?

Both the Libraries Connected website and the Scottish Library. Both are publicly funded bodies.

There is at least one particular exception to the general lack of interest in accessibility. Leeds libraries are clearly putting a lot of effort into this, and are doing their best to work with suppliers and look at their web presences to make these accessible.

It's no coicindence that Leeds are leading on their 100% digital programme, and

### Who cares?

Do public libraries care about any of this? Given current standards, no, it can't be said that in general libraries care about web accessibility.

But that's not malicious disregard for those who are unable to access their services. But it's also not from being unaware of it, being too busy, or not being able to do it. If those users were accessing libraries physically they would undoubtedly experience a top class service that is used to providing accessible options: large print books, guidance on using the Internet, and more.

The problem is from a lack of digital literacy in public libraries, particularly from leadership. Web accessibility is seen as a tech thing. Either the responsibility of IT, website providers, the Council web team, the LMS provider, anyone but the library service.

There are other symptoms of this. Library online presences are characterised by trying to adapt print experiences. Almost all libary reports are still release online as PDF files. And unless someone is willing to get their printer and print out those reports, they're not readable online.

As well as government guidelines on PDFs not being accessible, PDF files have always been a symptom of organisations that are not digitally capable.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">One of the best ways to measure digital information illiteracy is to measure the quantity of PDFs an org creates. A PDF is a sure sign that an org has not adapted to digital but is rather forcing digital to adapt to its print culture and practices.</p>&mdash; Gerry McGovern (@gerrymcgovern) <a href="https://twitter.com/gerrymcgovern/status/1284824726200778755?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 19, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

There are other examples everywhere. Library services used REading Agency poster templates to put their events into poster format and then distributed those as images on social media. In some cases they were the only way library events were available online. It seems reasonle but at the same time ridiculous. "Well, we normally create a poster so we'll do the same thing and put the image online"

#### What is the answer>

Well, I don't know. The inconvenient truth of the legislation is that previously this may have just been a bit rubbish. But now it's illegal. And it looks partiuculalry bad for libraries.
