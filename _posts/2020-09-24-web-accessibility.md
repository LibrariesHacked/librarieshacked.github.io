An earlier post in this blog, [public library websites](https://blog.librarydata.uk/public-library-websites/), looked at common problems with library websites.

One of these was accessibility, and how important it was for libraries to make better web content that everyone could access.

### What is web accessibility?

It is already necessary to make adjustments to ensure services can be used by all citizens. But the Public Sector Bodies Accessibility Regulations 2018 went further for web accessibility. Public sector websites should be accessible to a particular standard: AA from the [WCAG 2.1 standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/understanding-wcag). They must also publish an Accessibility Statement, which should say how this has been achieved, and plans to address any problems.

2018? Old news! There has been a period of grace to get websites up to standard, this came to an end on 23rd September 2020. More comprehensive guidelines are available at [accessibility requirements for public sector websites and apps](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps).

A common example of inaccessible web content is hyperlinks with the text 'click here'. People do this because they've seen it a lot. But it makes little sense when you consider that to 'click' is not always relevant, unless using a mouse. And the word 'here' is only valid when browsing the website in a visual way. It makes assumptions about how the user is interacting with the page.

Imagine you are reading the text of the page to a user, and they ask for a list of the links to other pages. If the page had ten 'click here' links you may end up saying "well, you can go to 'click here', or 'click here', or 'click here'..".

It's the equivalent of a signpost having 'this way' written for each direction, instead of place names. Completely useless, and a sure way of ensuring people become lost and annoyed.

But it's an easy mistake to make, and there are other common examples.

#### Appropriate contrast between foreground text and background

You may have a lovely high quality monitor that makes your website look great. But not everyone has the same hardware, or the same eyesight. Having a high contrast between text and background helps to make text clear.

  <figcaption>It can often be tempting to have low contrast for subtle design purposes, but the contrast here is far too low.</figcaption>

#### Don't rely on people being able to recognise an image

Many people rely on screen readers. Images are of no use, as they cannot be 'read'.

A common mistake on library websites is to link to external resources by their logo. Sometimes a series of logos with no text. To library staff, these are treasured and expensive e-resources. To the public it's a meaningless series of links that they're unlikely to follow.

  <figcaption>This series of links may look familiar to libraries, but will mean nothing to those not viewing the images. They are even unlikely to mean much to anyone who doesn't know what they are.</figcaption>

  <figcaption>There are many issues with this way of providing access to Ancestry. The click 'here' link, alongside making it necessary to recognise the Ancestry logo. And just complex instructions!</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Don't use colour as the only way of conveying meaning

Colour is great. But it should not be necessary to need to recognise colours. That means trying to find different methods in graphs and diagrams to convey meaning. For mobile library timetables, this means not having a calendar with dates coloured to indicate when the mobile library is visiting.

Accessible design makes the web better for everyone. Everyone wants content that is clear, well laid out, with plain language, descriptive links, good spacing around buttons, etc. All these things are welcome, and make a site nice and easy to use. And that increases usage. It's win-win.

The best websites make mistakes. I'm not an accessibility expert, and there's no substitute for accessibility testing from users. But trying to follow accessibility guidelines, attempting good content, and publishing an accessibility statement shows that as an organisation you care about trying to make things better, and will correct mistakes.

### How are libraries doing?

Feedback from the previous post about library webpages was that it essentially wasn't the library service's fault. "Libraries often don't have access to edit web content, sometimes there are strict controls from their parent council" was the argument.

And that's understanstandable. How can you make something better if you're not allowed near it? But this didn't ring true. Local government has some good digital practice. If you join the [Local Gov Digital Slack group](https://localgov.digital) you will see a healthy and thriving community of people who have been discussing accessibility issues for the last two years.

I also noticed that it was library content held on council sites that was most likely to be good. Content on library catalogue sites, away from Council interference, was particularly bad. The greater the library involvement, the worse things became.

To try to eliminate Council influence I looked again at library websites, but only where the website wasn't part of the Council site. The test was simple, how many of these had an accessibility statement that would comply with the 2018 legislation?

Of 34 sites, the number with compliant accessibility statements was two. Just over 5% legally compliant.

That's individual services, but what about the national leadership organisations?

Both [Libraries Connected](https://www.librariesconnected.org.uk) and the [Scottish Library and Information Council](https://scottishlibraries.org) are charities, but are publicly funded and subject to the legislation. Neither had Accessibility Statements, and both of them had accessibility issues on their websites.

There is at least one exception to this performance. Leeds Libraries are clearly putting a lot of effort into this, and are doing their best to work with suppliers to provide accessible websites.

### Who cares?

Do libraries care about any of this? Given current standards, no (with some exceptions).

But that's not malicious disregard for citizens. If those users were accessing libraries physically they would undoubtedly experience a top class service with accessible options: good buildings, large print books, guidance on using the Internet, and more.

The problem is digital literacy. Web accessibility is seen as a 'tech' thing. Either the responsibility of IT, website providers, the Council web team, the LMS provider. ut it's not, it's the responsibility of any service serious about having an online presence.

There are other symptoms as well as poor accessibility. Library online presences are characterised by adaptations of print experiences. All libary reports from library organisations are still released as PDF files. They're not truly published online, they are print formats made available to download and print.

[Gerry McGovern](https://gerrymcgovern.com), a particularly good writer on web content, summarised the use of PDFs in a recent tweet.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">One of the best ways to measure digital information illiteracy is to measure the quantity of PDFs an org creates. A PDF is a sure sign that an org has not adapted to digital but is rather forcing digital to adapt to its print culture and practices.</p>&mdash; Gerry McGovern (@gerrymcgovern) <a href="https://twitter.com/gerrymcgovern/status/1284824726200778755?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 19, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Libraries in lockdown have been forced online. But that has meant pushing print practices online, where they are inappropriate. Many services used poster templates to put their online events into image format, and then posted these on social media. In some cases the image was the only way to discover the events that were being run. That's not a mature digital service.

#### What is the answer?

Well, I don't know. The inconvenient truth for libraries is that previously this may have just been a bit rubbish. But now it's illegal.

Will that trigger a change? Probably not directly. But if enough enforcement action is taken then it's possible. The legislation is ultimately enforceable by the [Equality and Human Rights Commission](https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en). The public now have a clear right to a standard of accessible public websites, and this can be demanded through the EHRC.
