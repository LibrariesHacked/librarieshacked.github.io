An earlier post, [public library websites](https://blog.librarydata.uk/public-library-websites/), looked at common problems with library websites.

One of these was accessibility, and how important it for everyone to be able to access library services online.

### What is web accessibility?

It's necessary to ensure services are available to all citizens. The Public Sector Bodies Accessibility Regulations 2018 cover web accessibility and say that websites should be accessible to level AA from the [WCAG 2.1 standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/understanding-wcag). They must also publish an Accessibility Statement, which should say how this has been achieved, and plans to address any problems.

2018? Old news! There has been two years to allow websites to get up to standard, ending on 23rd September 2020. More comprehensive guidelines are available at [accessibility requirements for public sector websites and apps](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps).

A common example of inaccessible web content is links containing the text 'click here'. People do this because they've seen it a lot. But to 'click' is not always relevant, unless using a mouse. And the word 'here' is only valid when looking at the page. It makes assumptions about how users interact with web pages.

Imagine you are reading the page to someone, and they ask for the links to other pages. If it had many 'click here' links you'd end up saying "well, you can go to 'click here', or 'click here', or 'click here'..".

It's the equivalent of a signpost having 'this way' for each direction, instead of place names. Completely useless, and a sure way of ensuring people become lost and annoyed.

But it's an easy mistake to make, and there are other common problems.

#### Appropriate contrast for text

You may have a lovely monitor making your website look great. But not everyone has the same hardware, or the same eyesight. Having a high contrast between text and background helps make text clear.

#### Don't rely on people being able to recognise an image

Many people use screen readers. Images cannot be read, unless they have alternative text (be sure to always include this).

A common mistake on library websites is to link to resources by their logo alone. To library staff, these are treasured and expensive e-resources. To the public it's a meaningless series of logos that they're unlikely to follow.

<figure class="align-center">

  <figcaption>This series of links may look familiar to libraries, but will mean nothing to those who cannot see the images. They also won't mean much to anyone who doesn't know what they are.</figcaption>

#### Don't use colour alone to convey meaning

Colours are great. But it shouldn't be necessary to recognise them. Services need to find different methods to convey meaning. For mobile library timetables, this means not having a calendar with dates coloured to indicate when the mobile library is visiting.

<figure class="align-center">
  <img style="width: 50%; border: 1px solid #e5e5e5" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LibrariesHacked/librarieshacked.github.io/master/images/2020-09-24-accessibility-colour.PNG" alt="A sample image showing a single calendar month with the date numbers coloured differently to indicate which route the mobile library will be taking."/>

Accessible design is better for everyone. Everyone wants content that's clear, well laid out, with plain language, and descriptive links. All these things make a site easier to use. That increases usage and is win-win.

The best websites make mistakes. I'm no accessibility expert, and there's no substitute for real user testing. By trying to follow guidelines, attempting good content, and publishing a statement, it shows that you care about trying to make things better.

### How are libraries doing?

Feedback from the previous post about library webpages was that it wasn't the library's fault. "Libraries often aren't allowed by the parent council to change the web content" was the argument.

And that's understandable. How can you make something better if you're not allowed to? But this didn't ring true. Local government has good shared practice. If you join the [Local Gov Digital Slack group](https://localgov.digital) you will see a thriving community of people who have been discussing accessibility issues for the last two years.

I also noticed library information on council sites was more likely to be good. Content on library catalogue sites, away from council interference, was particularly bad. The greater the library involvement, the worse things became.

To try to eliminate Council influence I looked again at library websites, but only where the main website wasn't part of the Council site. The test was simple, how many had an accessibility statement that would comply with the legislation?

Of 34 sites, there were two compliant.

What about national organisations? [Libraries Connected](https://www.librariesconnected.org.uk) and the [Scottish Library and Information Council](https://scottishlibraries.org) are charities, but are publicly funded and subject to the legislation. Neither had Accessibility Statements, and both had accessibility issues on their websites.

There is at least one exception. Leeds Libraries are clearly putting a lot of effort into accessibility, and appear to be doing their best to work with suppliers to provide good websites.

### Who cares?

Do libraries care about any of this? Given current standards, no, with exceptions.

That's not malicious disregard for citizens. For users accessing physical libraries they will experience a top-class service with accessible options: good buildings, large print books, guidance on using the Internet, and more.

The problem is digital literacy. Web accessibility is seen as a 'tech' thing. Either the responsibility of IT, or website providers. Even though it affects users being able to access services.

There are other symptoms of digital literacy problems. Library online presences look like adapted print experiences. All reports from library organisations are still released as PDF files. That's not online publishing, it's print formats made available to download.

[Gerry McGovern](https://gerrymcgovern.com), a particularly good writer on web content, summarised the use of PDFs in a recent tweet.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">One of the best ways to measure digital information illiteracy is to measure the quantity of PDFs an org creates. A PDF is a sure sign that an org has not adapted to digital but is rather forcing digital to adapt to its print culture and practices.</p>&mdash; Gerry McGovern (@gerrymcgovern) <a href="https://twitter.com/gerrymcgovern/status/1284824726200778755?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 19, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Libraries have been forced to push their existing practices online, where they are inappropriate. Over the summer many services used poster templates to put their events into image format, and then posted these on social media. In some cases the image was the only available listing of events. That isn't a digital service.

#### What is the answer?

Well, I don't know. The inconvenient truth for libraries is that previously this was just a bit rubbish. Now it's illegal.

Will that trigger a change? Probably not directly. But if enough enforcement action is taken then it's possible. The legislation is enforceable by the [Equality and Human Rights Commission](https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en). The public now have a clear right to accessible public websites, and this can be demanded through the EHRC.
