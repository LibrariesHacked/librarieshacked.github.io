It's easy to just say we've had too many reports and too little of doing anything. But this is the nature of an extremely risk-averse sector, where there are very few centralised responsibilities. The DCMS holds responsibility for libraries but will almost always refer back to the local government. This has led to the work by the libraries Taskforce, who are well aware . The most natural organisation to lead on coordinating action for all library services would be Libraries Connected, but they are the most risk averse of all of them.

Therefore we're left in a situation of endless reports.

This is highlighted in the situation with the IFLA Library Map of the World. FOr a long time there was no data for the United Kingdom until in the end [CIPFA sent off some of the CIPFA stats] to populate the map, a dubious thing in itself given that CIPFA is 


### What could an open data library schema look like

The libraries taskforce began work on 

| Data category | Description |

| Events |  |
| Visits |  |
| Staff |  |

### What data exists

| Dataset | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Public Lending Right | The British Library now hold reponsibility for PLR, the system that collects loans data from a regularly changing sample of library services. This is primarily used for paying authors to reimburse them for their items being loaned in libraries, but is also a key dataset that includes library usage over time, and listing of the books being loaned. In July 2018 this was updated to include eBook loans. |
| CIPFA Stats | About 80% of library services currently complete 
| CIPFA Plus |
| Neilsen LibScan |




1. Static Libraries
2. Public Libraries
3. Library Services
4. Library Usage

Impact is an odd one here because many people would say it is both the most important and the most difficult to measure.

I don't know whether it fits within a core dataset.
