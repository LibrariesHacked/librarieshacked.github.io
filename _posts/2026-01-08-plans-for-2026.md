Happy New Year, hopefully you all had a good break.

As 2026 starts it felt like a good time to assess upcoming strategy for the year, in an introspective way. The stated goal of Libraries Hacked is:

> Promoting open data and digital prototypes in libraries.

How can this be done in 2026?

## Open Data

Open data is data that anyone can access, use, and share. Public libraries have huge amounts of data, while not having the resources or time to do much with it. More should be invested in service skills and time, but it would be a huge benefit to make their data as widely available as possible. It is also fair to say that despite how brilliant and loved libraries are, a lack of data-informed policy and decisions is evident, and it would be a disservice to users not to address this.

Unfortunately times are tough and even engaging in opening up data is out of the reach of many services, and the heads of those services don't have the time or inclination while fighting declining budgets and trying to keep staff employed and branches open.

Everyone would love to have a culture of open data and working in the open to enable thriving services. Good data standards and open schemas for sharing data. Excellent data management and stewardship, and policies of open by default, aside from personal data. The data would be available through public APIs (application programming interfaces) or data downloads depending on situation.

But we don't have those things. and getting even close to that level of data maturity is a long task.

So, what to focus on for 2026? There have always been a few 'low hanging fruit' quick wins for public libraries. The British Library Public Lending Right team are in the process of collecting comprehensive loans data from all public library services on what titles have been loaned, and we'll continue to push for this to be open.

There are other library organisations working on library data. The Arts Council and Libraries Connected have hugely increased data projects in recent years. However, while sympathetic and even supportive of open data, the remit of their projects are to serve the sector.

A recent Libraries Connected commissioned report, conducted by Independent Mind (Libraries Connected publishes new report on library loan trends | Libraries Connected) gathered loans data from 34 library services and analysed it. However, the outputs from that project were 2 PDF files and an internal webinar for library services. In a culture of working in the open, the first thing would be to make the data repeatable and open, release commisioned research as accessible web content, and then an open webinar.

This isn't a major criticism, but we do need to recognise the current culture. Research is conducted in individual projects, hugely inefficient and not serving long term goals or shared analysis.

Anyway, it's good to have a clear task that is distinct from other organisations. Open data advocacy and pressure needs to come from outside the sector so that'll obviously continue. Libraries Hacked will also collect data from library services using Freedom of Information requests. These will remain genuine requests for data, there's no point spamming services for no reason - but it is currently the only public mechanism for obtaining data and keeps public data on the radar.

When data is released openly by libraries it's important to keep on top of it. In 2025 the Arts Council released a high level usage dataset across most of English library services. Within weeks a Libraries Hacked project published the Library acitivty dashboard, and this will continue to be enhanced, and then updated to include future data.

## Digital prototypes

A prototype is an initial version or representation of a digital product like a web application. It may be working, to an extent, but is closer to a proof of concept or simulation than something real.

Libraries Hacked digital prototypes have always gone a bit further than this, so the term is slightly misleading. Library Map, for example, was originally developed in 2020 and has clocked up many hundreds of hours of development time on it. In commercial terms that would amount to tens if not hundreds of thousands of pounds. As a prototype it did its job though. For a while it was directly used on the LibraryOn website, now properly replaced by their own excellent Library Finder. Hopefully projects like Mobile Libraries can go on to inform future library sector developments in areas like communicating mobile library timetables.

As an aside, if anyone ever begrudges digital projects like LibraryOn, good digital applications that are developed properly need a lot of time and investment, and the sector really needs applications that they develop and own. The library sector is immensely lucky that there is a good digital product team dedicated to public libraries, and needs to help it succeed, try to give it more work and tasks, and cling on to it for as long as possible.

For 2026, one Libraries Hacked prototype is lined up. A mobile application (a proper one on the app stores) that helps people discover libraries when they are out and about by detecting local libraries. Nothing too complicated, and more tourist-y than really practical. But a good opportunity to experiment.

Other than that it will be chilling out!
