Happy New Year! Hopefully you all had a good break.

As 2026 starts it felt like a good time to assess upcoming Libraries Hacked strategy for the year, in an introspective way. The stated goal of Libraries Hacked is:

> Promoting open data and digital prototypes in libraries.

How can this be done in 2026?

## Open Data

Open data is data that anyone can access, use, and share. Public libraries have huge amounts of data locked away, while not having the resources or time to do much with it. More should be invested in service skills and time, but it would be a huge benefit to make data as widely available as possible. It is also fair to say that despite how brilliant and loved libraries are, a lack of data-informed policy and decisions is consistently evident, and it would be a disservice to users not to address this urgently.

Unfortunately times are tough and even engaging in open data is out of the reach of many services. The heads of those services don't have the time or inclination, while fighting declining budgets and trying to keep staff employed and branches open. Where data analysis *is* being done, it's largely in advocacy and social value analysis that doesn't deliver either insight or improvement, driven through a need to convince funders that libraries are worthwhile. 

Everyone would love a culture of open working to improve services. Good data standards and open schemas for sharing data. Excellent data management and stewardship, and policies of open by default (aside from personal data). The data would be available through public APIs (application programming interfaces) or data downloads depending on situation. But we don't have those things, and getting close to that level of data maturity is a long task.

So, what to focus on in 2026? There have always been a few 'low hanging fruit' wins for public libraries. The British Library Public Lending Right team are in the process of collecting comprehensive loans data from all public library services on what titles have been loaned, and we'll [continue to push for this to be open](https://blog.librarydata.uk/plr-consultation-2025/).

There are other library organisations working on library data. The Arts Council and Libraries Connected have significantly increased data projects in recent years. However, while sympathetic and even supportive of open data, the remit of their projects is to serve sector stakeholders.

A recent [Libraries Connected commissioned report, conducted by Independent Mind](https://www.librariesconnected.org.uk/news/libraries-connected-publishes-new-report-library-loan-trends) gathered loans data from 34 library services and analysed it. However, the outputs from that project were 2 PDF files and an internal webinar for library services. In a culture of working in the open, the default would be to ensure the data was repeatable and open, release analysis as accessible web content, and then an open webinar.

This isn't an individual criticism, this is the way things are generally done. But we do need to recognise the huge task in changing that culture. 

Anyway, it's good to have a different focus to other organisations, and open data advocacy and pressure needs to come from outside the sector and its leadership. Libraries Hacked will also collect data from library services [using Freedom of Information requests](https://blog.librarydata.uk/requesting-data-with-foi/). These will remain genuine requests for data, there's no point spamming services for no reason - but it is currently the only public mechanism for obtaining data and keeps public data on the radar.

When data is released openly by libraries it's important to keep on top of it. In 2025 the Arts Council released a high level library usage dataset across most of English library services. Within weeks a Libraries Hacked project published the [Library activity dashboard](https://activity.librarydata.uk/), and this will continue to be enhanced, and then updated to include future data.

## Digital prototypes

A prototype is an initial version or representation of a digital product (such as a web application). It may be working, to an extent, but is closer to a proof of concept or simulation rather than something real.

Libraries Hacked digital prototypes have always gone a bit further in creating working prototypes, so the term is slightly misleading. [Library Map](https://www.librarymap.co.uk/) was originally developed in 2020 and has clocked up many hundreds of hours of development time on it. In commercial terms that would amount to hundreds of thousands of pounds, excessive for a prototype! Hopefully it did its job - for a while it was directly used on the LibraryOn website, now properly replaced by their own [excellent Library Finder](https://libraryon.org/libraries). Hopefully [projects like Mobile Libraries](https://www.mobilelibraries.org/) can go on to inform future library sector developments in areas like communicating mobile library timetables.

As an aside, if anyone ever begrudges the investment in digital projects like LibraryOn, it's a reality that good digital applications, developed properly, need a lot of time and money. The public library sector also really publicly developed and owned applications. We're immensely lucky that there is an excellent digital product team dedicated to libraries, and we need to help it succeed, try to give it more work, and cling on to it for as long as possible.

For 2026, one Libraries Hacked prototype is lined up. A mobile application (a proper one on the app stores) that helps people discover libraries when they are out and about by detecting when they are close to them. Nothing too complicated, and more tourist-y than really practical. But a good opportunity to experiment and create something fun.

Other than that it will mainly be chilling out!
