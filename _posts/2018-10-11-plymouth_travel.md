One of the long-running Libraries Hacked #librarydata projects is a library finder. This uses Plymouth Libraries' open data on library locations, facilities, and opening hours. Like most projects, it is never ending, and never finished.

Plymouth Libraries have embraced open data, releasing [data about their libraries](https://www.plymouth.gov.uk/libraries/aboutlibraryservice/librarydata), as well as the Council holding a library themed [DataPlay event](http://www.dataplymouth.co.uk/articles/data-play-9-itinerary), inviting the public to get involved with library data.

One of the datasets is [Libraries in Plymouth](https://www.plymouth.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Plymouth%20library%20locations%2C%20opening%20hours%20and%20services_0.csv), a listing of the 12 libraries, with their address and opening hours.

## Facilities

If you're searching for a library you may have a particular task in mind. 


## Events

If you want to infuriate people, say that "Libraries are not just about books". With a deepo emphasis on the 'just', to make the contempt for books really clear. But it's literally true, libraries aren't just about books. they have events going on as well. So those should be represented in data about libraries.

Over the course of each day the script updates it's listing of library events from the website


## Building

Normally when you plot a library on the map it will show some kind of icon. Maybe a book, or just a stanndard map marker. But what about showing the actual library? Something
