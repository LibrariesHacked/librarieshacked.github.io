Conversations come and go about national open data that would give an accurate picture of public libraries. Their locations, staff, type, financial details, stock, and what goes on in them.

What would be required to encourage all UK public libraries to publish accurate and timely data to a set standard? Some ideas here.

## Think local

There are various examples of national library statistics. These generally list high-level comparative stats. For example, issues per year, per authority. Probably not listing individual libraries.

The problem with this data is that it rarely has any use. No local authority would internally accept data without the detail of each library, why compile lots of useless data nationally?

Although the end goal may be to have national data, the starting point needs to be good local data in a standard form.

> Task 1: Create a schema for library data that presents data that could be used at an local level

## Make it useful

National stats were made simple for a reason. One of which would have been to make the data more manageable. Perhaps easier to publish on paper, and compile manually. Having detailed borrowing data per library may be fine locally, but at a national level? Excel would explode! 

Except it wouldn't. Not any more. We have powerful computers and Excel will be fine. The more detail, the more that can be done. Even monthly data isn't really enough. What does that tell us about different days of the week? Nothing.

> Task 2: Make the data schema comprehensive and as detailed as possible

[Dogfooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food), is a term to describe using your own product.

In open data, this means testing and using the data internally. It's surprisingly common for public data to be quite different from that which is used internally by organisations. It will often contain fewer details, or be aggregated.

The goal of publishing data is for it to be used, so let's make it useful using library expertise. Then get early feedback from the public and data analysts as to what they'd expect to see.

> Task 3: Trial data exports with volunteer authorities. Run public events to get feedback on the data

## Promote differences

If you tell a service that you want comparable data, the immediate assumption may be that you want to see which ones are 'good' or 'bad'.

That is a goal only served by over-simplified data. People genuinely interested in libraries will want to understand differences. We know that some library services have seen increases in borrowing, while others have seen a decrease. That could be for all sorts of reasons, differences in opening hours, socioeconomic factors, location of libraries, shifting trends in high street use, etc.

It's important to emphasise that more is not better. The numbers don't matter, the reasons for differences do. Some libraries may have an increase in borrowing purely due to their location. Good for them, but they're no more successful or important than a library that has a decrease in borrowing but is in a particularly deprived area.

> Task 4: Commission analysis projects to look at key questions using trial authority data. Make the process openly available to authorities publishing using the data schema.

## Promote data for telling stories

Data has a bad reputation in public libraries, and the people tasked with doing it will likely be sick of it.

At one local authority, library data meant keying data manually into a 'key performance metric' system every month. This included book issues and visits per library. Data from other council services also went into the system. That's a dull job even for someone who loves data. But with libraries, performance being summarised and reported to senior leaders and councillors with just a slow downward trend must be soul-destroying.

That's not how to use data. Data tells us stories about things we are curious about. We don't need it to prove worth, but it's useful for improving services, and making data-informed decisions.

A culture of curiosity about libraries should be enough to encourage data publishing. When is the library most busy? Is that the same everywhere? Is it affected by weather? What about local events and footfall in the surrounding town?

There are also policies that data can inform. Ever wondered if fines really are effective? If you can't remove fines, would lowering them actually bring in more money? What about loan periods for different types of items?

An [Open Data Literacy](https://twitter.com/ODLiteracy) project in Seattle has been working with interns to publish stories about library data, and they are wonderful. See this one about using [census data in public libraries](https://medium.com/open-data-literacy/beyond-the-census-using-census-data-in-public-libraries-333e2643fd21) or the [hipster reading list](https://pudding.cool/2019/06/summer-reading/) of books that haven't been taken out for 10 years.

> Task 5: Blog and experiment with the data. Create interesting stories and make them reproduceable

## Provide training

Most essentially, library staff need the skills to do this job themselves. To dictate what they want to find out about their library, and to get away from boring data reporting that doesn't serve their needs.

There are some excellent resources for data training. Artefacto publish listings of [Free resources to help library staff level up and learn new skills](https://libraryskills.io/), and [library carpentry lessons and workshops](https://librarycarpentry.org/lessons/) are freely available for anyone to use for training materials.  

But having standard data would really allow for training materials that taught library staff how to use the data that they would hold. Workshops and training events would allow staff to use their own data with set examples.

> Task 6: Create training materials for the data. Run workshops across the UK to provide hands on training opportunities for those authorities publishing the data
