Conversations come and go about compiling open data that would give an accurate picture of UK public libraries. Their locations, staff, type, financial details, stock, and what goes on in them.

What would be required to encourage all UK public libraries to publish accurate and timely data to a set standard? Some ideas here.

## Think local

There are various examples of national library statistics. These normally provide high-level comparative stats at large intervals. For example, issues per year, per authority. Probably not including individual libraries.

The problem with this data is that it has no actual use. No local authority would accept data internally without the detail of each library. So why compile lots of useless data nationally?

Although the end goal is to have national data, the starting point needs to be local data in a standard form.

> Task 1: Create a schema for library data that presents data that could be used at an local level

## Make it useful

National stats were made simple for reasons. One of these would have been to make the data more manageable. Perhaps easier to compile and publish on paper. Having borrowing data per library may be fine for one service, but at a national level? Excel would explode! 

Except it wouldn't. Computers are powerful and Excel will be fine. The more detail, the more that can be done. Even monthly data isn't really enough. What does that tell us about how Monday compares to Friday? Nothing.

> Task 2: Make the data schema comprehensive and as detailed as possible

[Dogfooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food), is a term to describe using your own product.

In open data, this means testing and using the data internally. Don't publish what you know wouldn't be useful for yourself.

The goal of publishing data is for it to be used, so let's make it useful, using library expertise. Then get early feedback from the public and data analysts as to what else they'd like to see.

> Task 3: Trial data exports with volunteer authorities. Run public events to get feedback on the data

## Promote difference

Libraries all do things differently, and the data will be very different. Some libraries may use 100 item types to categorise their stock, others may have 20.

Attempts at standardising data often attempt to make these uniform. For example, they provide a set of item types that each library has to map their own to. A waste of time, and ultimately a loss of data, as those differences are one of the interesting parts of the data. It also makes things harder. Someone else can always do that mapping later on if they want to.

> Task 4: Ensure the data schema enforces a standard structure to the data, but allows for useful differences in the data content

If you tell services that you want comparable data, the immediate assumption may be that you want to see which are 'good' or 'bad'.

That's a goal only served by over-simplified data. People genuinely interested in libraries will want to understand differences. We know that some library services have increases in borrowing, while others have seen a decrease. That could be for all sorts of reasons, differences in opening hours, socioeconomic factors, location of libraries, shifting trends in high street use, etc.

It's important to emphasise that more is not better. The numbers don't matter, the reasons for them do. Some libraries may have an increase in borrowing purely due to their location. Good for them, but they're no more important than a library with a decrease in borrowing that serves a particularly deprived area.

> Task 5: Commission projects to look at key questions using trial authority data. Make the process openly available to authorities publishing using the data schema.

## Tell stories

Data has a bad reputation in public libraries, and the people tasked with doing it will be sick of it.

At one local authority, library data meant keying data into a 'key performance indicators' system every month. This included book issues and visits per library. Data from other council services also went into the system. It would be a dull job even for someone who loved data. But for libraries, performance being reported to senior leaders and councillors as a slow downward trend must be soul-destroying.

That's not how to use data. Data tells us stories about things we are curious about. We don't need it to prove worth, but it's useful for improving services, and making data-informed decisions.

A culture of curiosity about libraries should be enough to encourage data publishing. When is the library most busy? Is that the same everywhere? Is it affected by weather? What about local events and footfall in the surrounding town?

There are also policies that data can inform. Ever wondered if fines really are effective? If you can't remove fines, would lowering them actually bring in more money? What about loan periods for different types of items?

An [Open Data Literacy](https://twitter.com/ODLiteracy) project in Seattle has been working with interns to publish stories about library data, and they are wonderful. See this one about using [census data in public libraries](https://medium.com/open-data-literacy/beyond-the-census-using-census-data-in-public-libraries-333e2643fd21) or the [hipster reading list](https://pudding.cool/2019/06/summer-reading/) of books that haven't been taken out for 10 years.

> Task 6: Blog and experiment with the data. Create interesting stories and make them reproduceable

## Automate it

Noone likes doing the same thing with data all the time. Extracting and publishing datasets should be as automated a task as possible.

We don't have that many library systems in public libraries. 5 or so? Capita, Civica, Axiell, SirsiDynix, Infor. Probably something else as well, and Durham seem to have their own. But that's around 5 pieces of work to automate those datasets, not 200.

> Task 7: Pay a reasonable fee to library suppliers, or individuals experienced with each system, to extract the data on an automated basis. Document it and ensure it's a process every service can implement.

## Provide training

Most essentially, library staff need the skills to do data work themselves. To dictate what they want to find out about their library, and to get away from boring data reporting that doesn't serve their needs.

There are some excellent resources for data training. Artefacto publish listings of [Free resources to help library staff level up and learn new skills](https://libraryskills.io/), and [library carpentry lessons and workshops](https://librarycarpentry.org/lessons/) are freely available for anyone to use.  

But having standard data would allow for training materials that taught library staff how to use the actual data that they would hold. Workshops and training events would give staff the opportunity to use their own data with set examples.

> Task 8: Create training materials with the data. Run workshops across the UK to provide hands on training opportunities for those authorities publishing it
