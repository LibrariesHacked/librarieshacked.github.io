[Libraries hacked](https://www.librarieshacked.org) is a website designed to promote open-source technology hacks and projects in libraries.

#### Data sources

The site will highlight where to find library data sources around the web, focussing on **web services** and **APIs**, as these are most useful when creating new solutions.

#### Open-source code

Though not exclusively limited to featuring open-source solutions, the site will act as a platform for hosting code repositories (through GitHub), and any code created through the site will be made available and open.

Examples of interesting open-source library projects around the web will also be listed.

#### Hack events in libraries

**Hacks** produce technological solutions created within communities, to provide innovative uses of data. 

Libraries are places for data and information, and making that open to the community.  A natural setting for hack projects is therefore a library, which is why this site will focus on library hack events.

#### Articles and collaboration

Articles from a variety of sources will be put on the site to provide guidance for those interested in the technology.  Some examples of these will be:

- library technology suppliers detailing the technological aspects of their solutions.
- descriptions of tools used for data analysis. 
- experiences of library hack events.

Any contributors will be given a link to work on an article which can directly be published to the site, and they will have access to this to make modifications as necessary.

#### Events

With a National libraries festival, Exeter Fab lab, Pi and Mash, and more, there is already an exciting lineup for 2014.

Website launch dates tend to be the point a website is ready to begin, rather than a date when it is finished.  In this case it is definitely the former - more content will be available soon.
