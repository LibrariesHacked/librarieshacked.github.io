There is a good general principle in understanding data and information: information is an output from processing data. Data in, information out. Things get a lot more complex than that, and it's not a perfect representation, but I quite like it.

Data analysis should follow this pattern. The addition of a feedback loop represents that analysis is most effective when you have continuous improvement. You start with your data sources, process them, and end up with information - and hopefully with some expertise you get some insight. Then you adjust things and go back to the start.

I've noticed that discussions involving public library data rarely involve this idea. Some of the key data for public libraries is primarily described as an output rather than an input. And specifically one that is used to show how the service is doing as a measure of quality.

Is this just because systems and processes generate data and therefore it's fair to say it's some kind of output? It would be more accurate to say that data is collected and generated during the running of a system, and is a by-product rather than any kind of output.

Or is it just because these are mainly discussions that involve statistics rather than raw data? [Statistics are different from data](https://libguides.lib.msu.edu/datastats), but if you ask for data from libraries they are more likely to give you statistics. That can be argued to be a kind of output as it comes from processing data. 

Fair agument, but these statistics tend to be from pre-defined measures that are so basic that they rarely represent anything beyond a summary of the raw data held in the system. For example, they might be a count of loans per month, rather than an actual dataset of loans.

And perhaps that is the problem - the rest of the world has moved on from those kind of statistics being considered in any way an output. Where once a report of the count of loans per library per month was seen as management information, processed from a sophisticated library system, this is now just a loss of detail from the raw data.

Much off this comes from outdated performance measurement methodology. Decide what you want to measure and perceive as good, and report on it. But data analysis is far more sophisticated as well as accessible these days. You can have all the data on library loans available in pretty much real time, merged with data on library and city footfall, as well as all manner of data sources. There is no need to decide on clunky performance measures - provide people with the data to explore in realtime and make decisions on.

## Examples

But is this all imagination? There's a lot in this writing that appears to be vague impression rather than reality. There are plenty of examples.

This was in a recent article about Suffolk libraries. I'd agree here that number of loans isn't interesting as an output. But that data isn't an output at all, it's an unprocessed input. If you come at it from that angle, the course-correction is to start processing it in order to get insight. However, it seems the proposal here is to discard that data in favour of something more mystical.

> Public Libraries Online, [Inputs, Outputs, and Outcomes - Oh My!](http://publiclibrariesonline.org/2014/12/inputs-outputs-and-outcomes-oh-my/).

Similar perhaps to the above, I'm not sure this really represents what an output is, other than presenting it as an overly simplistic aggregation of data (activity size).

In all these cases 'Outcomes' are raised - in general as preferential to outputs. This doesn't really make any sense if you go back to the basics of what an output is. The definition of outcomes generally seem more vague, but in any case need to go through the same data processing to produce information. At the moment it seems like outcomes is a fancy way of saying information output, but removing certain kinds of unwanted data from that process.

## Why does this happen?

I think it's fair to say that mixing up inputs and outputs, and also mistakenly perceiving outputes to be an alternative, is prevalent across the public library sector.

There isn;t really a mystery of why this happens:

1. Lbraries current use outdated simplified statistics for their data sources and define these as performance measures
2. These show terrible performance because they 




An overly simplistic representatop 

1. The library does library things
2. 


## What to do?

1. Open data.
