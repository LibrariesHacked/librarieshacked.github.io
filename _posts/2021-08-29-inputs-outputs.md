One thing has remained generally fixed about my understanding of data and information: information systems process data into information. Data in, information out. Things get a lot more complex than that, and it's not a perfect representation, but I quite like it.

Isung data generally follows this pattern. The addition of the feedback loop represents that it's most efficient when you have continuous improvement. You start with your data sources, process them, and end up with information - and hopefully insight. Then you go back to the start.

I've noticed that public libraries rarely follow this pattern when discussing data. Some of the key data that is stored in library systems is primarily described as an output rather than an input. And specifically one that is used to represent how the service is doing, or some kind of measure of worth.

Is this just representing that systems and processes generate data and therefore it must be some kind of output? It's probably more accurately to say that data is collected and manipulated during the running of a system, and is a byproduct or aspect of the process rather than any kind of output.

Or is it just that they're largely talking about statistics rather than raw data. Often described as measures where for example the chosen measure is number of visitors. Therefore the data has already been through some kind of independent processing to create that statistical information. This is true to an extent, but the measures are so basic that the rarely represent anything beyond that the data is held in the system. It would be an argument belonging to the last century to consider these things to be processed data.


## Examples

> Bruce says statistics around libraries often involve outputs, like numbers of books loaned. "What we are really interested in are not just outputs but outcomes."
> Bruce Leek<cite> from How Suffolk libraries have turned the page to a new chapter</cite>

This is pretty interesting cos I'd agree that number of loans isn't interesting as an output. But that data isn't an output at all, it's an unprocessed input. If you come at it from that angle then the course-correction to it not being interesting is to start processing it in order to get insight (and outcomes). However, it seems the proposal here is to discard that data in favour of other sources, which is wrong.





I think it's fair to say that mixing up inputs and outputs is prevalent across the public library sector. There are opportunities to change this though:
