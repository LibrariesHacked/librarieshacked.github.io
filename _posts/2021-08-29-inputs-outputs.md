There is a good general principle in understanding data and information: information is an output from processing data. Data in, information out. Things get a lot more complex than that, and it's not a perfect rule, but I quite like it.

Data analysis should follow this pattern. The addition of a feedback loop is there to show that it's most effective when you have continuous improvement. You start with your data sources, process them, and end up with information - and hopefully with some expertise you get some insight. Then you adjust things and go back to the start.

I've noticed that discussions involving public library data rarely involve this idea of data as an input. Some of the key data for public libraries is primarily described as an output. And always specifically an output that is used to show how the quality of the service.

Systems and processes generate data and therefore surely it's fair to say that data is some kind of output? Not really, it would be more accurate to say that data is collected and generated during the running of a system, and is a by-product.

Or is it just because these are mainly discussions that involve statistics, rather than raw data? [Statistics are different from data](https://libguides.lib.msu.edu/datastats) and can legitimately be argued to be a kind of output from processing data. But these particular statistics tend to be from measures that are so basic that they are at most a summary of the raw data held in the system. For example, they might be a count of loans per month, rather than an actual table of loans.

And perhaps that is the problem - the rest of the world has moved on from simple aggregation being considered an output. Where once a report of the count of loans per library per month was seen as management information, processed from a sophisticated library management system, this is now just a loss of detail of the raw data.

This mostly comes from outdated performance measurement methodology. Decide what you want to measure and and report on it, at simplistic levels of detail. But data analysis is far more sophisticated, as well as accessible, these days. You can have all the data on library loans merged with data on library and city footfall, as well as all manner of data sources.

There is no need to use clunky performance measures - provide people with the data to explore and make decisions on the information that results from that process. Data in, information out.

## Examples

But is this all imagination? There's a lot in this that appears to be vague impression rather than reality. Here are a couple of examples.

> Bruce says statistics around libraries often involve outputs, like numbers of books loaned. "What we are really interested in are not just outputs but outcomes."
> Bruce Leek, from Suffolk Libraries, in the article [How Suffolk libraries have turned the page to a new chapter](https://www.suffolknews.co.uk/mildenhall/how-suffolk-libraries-have-turned-the-page-to-a-new-chapter-9210820/)

This was in a recent article about Suffolk libraries. I'd agree here that number of loans isn't interesting as an output. But that data isn't really an output at all, it's an unprocessed input. If you come at it from that angle, the solution is to start processing it in order to get real insight. However, it seems the proposal is to discard that data in favour of something else.

> An output is a measurement of activity size and scope. An outcome shows the social value added. An output is a quantitative measurement. An outcome is generally a qualitative measurement.
> Public Libraries Online, the article [Inputs, Outputs, and Outcomes - Oh My!](http://publiclibrariesonline.org/2014/12/inputs-outputs-and-outcomes-oh-my/)

Similar to the above, I'm not sure this is correct in what an output is, it just presents it as an simplistic aggregation of data (activity size).

In both these cases 'outcomes' are raised - as preferential to outputs. This doesn't really make any sense if you go back to what an output is. Outcomes generally seem more vague, but in any case also need to go through data processing to produce information outputs.

## Why does this happen?

I think it's fair to say that mixing up inputs and outputs, and also perceiving outcomes to be an alternative, is prevalent across the public library sector.

There isn't really a mystery of why this happens:

1. Historic poor performance measures are mistakenly used to provide aggregated data as reportable outputs
2. These show poor performance as in general library use is declining
3. Alternatives to these datasets are sought - 'outcomes'. Primarily in initiatives to communicate the value of libraries in terms that aren't numbers

My full sympathy with library leaders having to go through this, but it's a . We are in a decade of accessible and powerful data analysis. Within minutes you can take library data on membership and loans and combine with other sources to see things like what demographics visited the library yesterday. Powerful tools. 

In turning against certain data, and seeking out alternative ways of communicating values libraries are letting slide the opportunity of actual useful data analysis that could genuinely dramatically increase use.
