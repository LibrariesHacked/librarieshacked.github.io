There is a good general principle for data and information: data in, information out. Things get a lot more complex than that, and it's not a perfect rule, but I like it.

Data analysis should follow this pattern. Adding a feedback loop shows that it's most effective when you have continuous improvement. You start with data sources, process them, and end up with information - hopefully with expertise you can also gain some insight. Then you adjust things and go back to the start.

I've noticed that discussions involving public library data rarely involve this idea of data as an input. Some of the key data for public libraries is often described as an output. And always an output used to determine the quality of the service.

Well, systems generate data so surely it's fair to say that data is also some kind of output? Not really, it would be more accurate to say that data is collected and generated during the running of a system as a by-product. But to be an information output it still needs to be processed.

Is it just because these are mainly discussions about library statistics, rather than data? [Statistics are different from data](https://libguides.lib.msu.edu/datastats) and can legitimately be argued to be an output as they have been calculated. But in library-world these tend to be so basic that they are often just counts of the raw data held in the system. For example, they might be a count of loans per year, rather than the actual table of loans.

And perhaps that is the problem - we should have moved on from simple aggregation and counts of data being considered an output. A report of the count of loans per library per month may previously have been management information, processed from a sophisticated library management system, but is now just a loss of detail from the raw data.

That also comes from outdated performance methodology. The theory goes that you decide what you think is good and you report on it. So you think if more loans is good, and fewer loans is bad, then all you need is a regular count of loans. But complex data analysis is far more sophisticated, as well as accessible, these days. You can have raw data on library loans merged with data on all manner of data sources that make it impossible to pre-define such measures. You just query the data for insight.

There is no need to use clunky pre-configured performance measures. Provide people with data and tools to explore the raw data. They can then make decisions on the information that results from that analysis process. Data in, information out.

## Examples

But is this all imagination? Here are a couple of examples.

This was from a recent article about Suffolk libraries. I'd agree with Bruce Leek here that number of loans isn't that interesting as an output. But it's not really an output at all, it's an unprocessed input. If you come at it from that angle, the task is to start processing it in order to get real insight.

I'm not sure this is correct in what an output is, it presents them as simplistic aggregations of data (activity size).

In both these cases 'outcomes' are raised - as preferential to outputs. This doesn't make any sense if you go back to an output being the result of data (qualitative or quantitative) processing.

## Why is this happening?

I think it's fair to say that a mixed up picture of inputs, outputs, and outcomes, is prevalent across the public library sector.

There isn't really a mystery of why this happens:

1. Historic performance measures are commonly used as reportable outputs

2. These declare poor performance, as library use is declining

3. Alternatives to this data is sought - 'outcomes'. This is primarily in initiatives to communicate the value of libraries for funding/survival purposes

My full sympathy with library leaders having to go through this, when there are so many better things to be doing. But we are in a decade of accessible and powerful data analysis tools. Within minutes you can take library data on membership and loans and combine with other sources. 

That may provide information on things like what demographics visited the library yesterday, and didn't. You can then likely start understanding why that was the case. Understanding who isn't using libraries would be of huge practical use, rather than worrying about what existing users get from the service.
