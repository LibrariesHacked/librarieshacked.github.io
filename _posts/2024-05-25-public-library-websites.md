I first started working on local Council websites in 2010. Moving from financial services customer relationship management software to local government was a big change, and I got to go straight in to working on Reading Borough Council's website.

One thing that happened during that time was that the library website got pulled back in to the main Council site. Not the catalogue website - that still tends to be delivered as yet another website. But the web pages that provide all the information about the library services fines and charges, opening hours, events, etc.

There is a rotating trend in local government to have library pages as a separate entity, and then part of the main Council website, and then back again. The process goes something like:

- Library service is disenchanted with the main Council site and wants to do it's own thing
- Library service gets a bit of money and spins out a new site
- Library service spends that bit of money and can't maintain the site
- Website stagnates and becomes a danger to itself and others
- Library service information gets pulled back in to the main Council site

And round again. That's a simplification, but it's not far off.

I am fortunate that I have worked in local government roles where I have experiences fantastic professional web content and development teams that are unsurpassed in knowledge, experience, care, and capability. A good web team is essential for a website, but it needs investment.

At Bristol City Council I worked in the digital transformation team, which included a few teams essentially creating and maintaining the website content, day to day running, and digital developments. I don't know the wage bill for the entire team, or the infrastructure and licensing costs, but it would probably be in the region of £1m per year. That's a lot of money, but it's a lot of website and a lot of expertise.

Does your library website:

- have a regular penetration test?
- have a regular accessibility audit?
- receive regular software updates?
- get security patches applied?
- have a support contract?

It's why I'm slightly sceptical of library services that want to go it alone with their own website. It doesn't mean discouraging it, but again, be aware of the investment and skills required.

To be fair, (almost) gone are the days when the library service website was developed by the enthusiastic member of staff who knew a bit of HTML, and also knew how to find bits of JavaScript online. They were able to add news text that scrolled across the screen, and a mouse trail that followed the cursor.

There are more than a few examples of that kind of poor fit between libraries and local government. Perhaps libraries just don't fit in to the local government model of

I'm generally a proponent of action, and sepcifically digital action. If a library service is developinng it's own website, then that's probably a good thing because it is engaged in digital development.

The LibrryOn grants have been great

But it's not all perfect news. It took a long time even for local Council's to pay attention to . Of X new websites, delivered in the , a total of 0 have an accessibility statement.

In 1 example of my busybodying around library websites I . I don't know if anything became of that grant, or the library service did manage to commision a website for £7,000. But I do know that the website would have been a bad idea.

There is no right or wrong model of digital autonomy for library services, but it's important to understand all the implications. How many people does a local Council employ who are experts on information governance for example? Maybe a small team of 2 or 3. Important expertise to have in a local authority, but stretched to have any true oversight of individual services.

With a spun-out librry service how many people are there? In reality none. However, the person tasked with information governance for the service potentially has

This is a blog post without any definitive answers or conclusions. But there are gaps in current thinking around library websites that need to be adresssed.
