One of the most interesting things about compiling [data on all the UK library services](https://airtable.com/shrKkzYDUNMMM6qrJ), was the opportunity to look through library websites. All UK service websites were checked in compiling the data.

There has been a renewed interest in the single digital presence work, and the British Library have [published a new blog on this](https://blogs.bl.uk/living-knowledge/2020/04/a-single-digital-presence-for-uk-libraries-the-project-and-the-platform.html). This links to a survey for library senior managers and heads of service. An interesting question asked is:

> Overall, how would you rate your online offer from a user perspective on a scale from 1-10? (1 being impossible to use and 10 being an unbeatable user offer)
- [Question asked for Awareness, Usability, and Value]

It will be very interesting to see Head of Service impressions of these things. As a member of the public looking through library websites to search for particular things, not many were good.

It would possibly be most useful to highlight the worst examples of websites. To know at least what to avoid. But it would also maybe not encourage change, so instead each the folllowing is a list of areas that seem like they could be improved. While also highlighting a library service that seems to do pretty well in each.

## Be accessible

There's no choice to this one. It's a legal requirement for public sector sector websites to follow [website accessibility legislation](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps). And not many do.

Most local councils will be auditing their websites to bring them up to scratch, to avoid facing penalties. However, libraries often have their own site, often through the library catalogue. This is not the supplier's responsibility, or IT, or the council digital service, but the responsibility of the library service. There are many aspects to going about the process of making web pages accessible, and it's not a process that ever stops. Here are some general tips.

1. Audit your webpages. This should be done by a professional service, but you can start with this [manual guide]().
2. Adopt a general rule and don't use any PDFs. They can be made accessible but it's not worth it.
3. Don't use any images for conveying essential text information. Imagine that the webpage is being read out by a screen reader - images are not readable text.
4. Don't use colour as the only way of conveying information.

Did any stand out as being clearly accessible?

## Make things simple

Simple was definitely better 

There's not that many things people can be looking 

1. Keep information on as few levels as possible. Ideally one single page should lst everything that the library offers. There can be sub pages underneath that one page, but it should be clear which page is the one people need.
2. Make getting in contact easy. The easiest ways are a phone number and email address.
3. A contact form is not a replacement for an email address.

The [Library of the Isles of Scilly](https://www.scilly.gov.uk/learning-leisure/library-0) manages to achieve more information in one small page than many seem to have across hundreds. It's worth a look. Sentences are short and beautiful. Information is clear.

## Don't have loads of providers for one type of eResource

This is all especially amazing give how much trouble users are put to in order to make use of eResources. Finding information about library eBooks often consists of a webpage that lists lots of strange names: uLIBRARY, OverDrive, CloudLibrary. As if people should know what these are and embrace them.

> Welcome to our Libraries. Looking for ebooks? Well, you can go here, or here, or here, or over here. Or click on this massive green box. We're not going to tell you why, or give any guidance on which to choose. Do you need instructions on how to use them? Here's an image you can download. Oh, and btw, each of them has different rules and lending periods.

What could be done to make things better?

1. Have a maximum of one provider for each type of eResource. I know that means less variety. It will still be better.
2. Provide accessible and simple instructions (web content, not PDF or image) for using the service.
3. Integrate the search for titles into your physical catalogue to make things easier.

## Beautiful design goes a long way

I have no design skills. So I tend to prefer things that are functional, and that use boring but clean design patterns.

When you find sites that have really good designs, it's noticeable. It can go a long way to making the library service enticing.

1. Get a designer onto the site!

Hamphire library service website](https://www.hants.gov.uk/librariesandarchives/library) demonstrates this well. There's quite a lot going on on that site. It's maybe a little overwhelming, and doesn't quite pass the simplicity test, but it makes the library service look like a service that is making a real effort.
