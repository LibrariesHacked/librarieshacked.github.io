An interesting part of compiling [data on UK library online services](https://airtable.com/shrKkzYDUNMMM6qrJ) was the opportunity to look through all UK library websites.

There has been fresh talk about a single digital presence for libraries in the UK. The British Library team have [published a new blog on this](https://blogs.bl.uk/living-knowledge/2020/04/a-single-digital-presence-for-uk-libraries-the-project-and-the-platform.html). They link to a survey for library senior managers and heads of service. One question asked is:

> Overall, how would you rate your online offer from a user perspective on a scale from 1-10? (1 being impossible to use and 10 being an unbeatable user offer)
- [Question repeated under categories of Awareness, Usability, and Value]

It will be interesting to see the impressions from senior managers. As a member of the public looking through library websites, they were a mixed bag.

It could be useful to highlight the worst examples, to know what to avoid. But it may not be effective in encouraging change, so instead this is a list of common areas that seem like they could be improved. While highlighting library services that were impressive in each.

## Make things simple

Simple was definitely better when looking for information. I want to go to the library homepage and find what I'm looking for very quickly. Too many levels of navigation was a problem. One click away from the homepage should really be enough. In general it became easier to use a search engine to find information.

### Tips

1. Keep information on as few levels as possible. One page can have links with everything the library offers. There can be single information pages underneath that one page, and it should be clear which is the one people need.
2. Make contact details easy. The easiest ways is to have a clear phone number and email address.
3. A contact form is not a replacement for an email address. It's especially annoying to have an 'email the library' link, which then goes through to a contact form.
4. Choose where you're going to have information. The council site or the catalogue one. 

### Example

The [Library of the Isles of Scilly](https://www.scilly.gov.uk/learning-leisure/library-0) manages to achieve more information in one small page than some had across many. It's worth a look. Sentences are beautifully short. Information is clear.

> St Mary's Library is a fantastic community facility located on Porthcressa seafront. It is easy to join and membership is free. Visitors may also take out temporary membership during their stay.

## Be accessible

There's no choice for this one. It's a legal requirement for public sector sector websites to follow [website accessibility legislation](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps). And not many currently do.

Most local councils will be auditing their websites to bring them up to scratch. Otherwise they could face penalties. However, libraries often also have their own site, often through the library catalogue. Accessibilit yon this site is the library service's. Not the supplier's, or IT, or the council digital service.

### Tips

1. Audit your webpages. This should be done by a professional service, but you can start with [guidelines on doing a basic accessibility check](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/doing-a-basic-accessibility-check-if-you-cant-do-a-detailed-one/doing-a-basic-accessibility-check-if-you-cant-do-a-detailed-one).
2. Remove all PDFs and replace them with web content.
3. Don't use any images for conveying essential text information. Imagine that the webpage is being read by screen reader software. Images are not readable text.
4. Don't use colour as the only way of conveying information.

### Example

For public sector webpages the only thing to do is get your site professionally audited. And get all content editors trained on accessibility. Good examples can change, and it's easy to quickly make a good site inaccessible by using an image inappropriately, or even a poorly worded link.

## Don't have loads of eResource providers

There's been a lot of attention on increased use of online library services, such as eBooks and eAudio. The [BBC have reported figures](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-52368191) showing some figures. Usage seems to have gone through the roof, up to very low now, from extremely low previously. Library online resources are fiddly things, consisting of third party sites to find content, apps to install on your phone and tablet, and eBooks with long waiting lists that won't work on your ereader.

Even modest increase in usage is impressive given the clarity of the offer. The information on library websites is often a webpage listing lots of strange names: uLIBRARY, OverDrive, CloudLibrary. As if people should know what these are, and be able to choose between them. Dividing an eBook offer across suppliers means services are often pushing 3 or 4 providers, with no guidance for which to go for.

> Welcome to our Libraries. Looking for ebooks? Well, you can go here, or here, or over here. Or click this massive green box. We're not going to tell you why, or give any guidance on which to choose. Do you need instructions on how to use them? Here's an image you can download. Oh, and each of them has different rules and lending periods. You'll find out though.

### Tips

1. Have a maximum of one provider for each type of eResource. Less variety but far more clarity.
2. Provide accessible and simple instructions for using the service.
3. Integrate the search for titles into your main catalogue.

### Example

There's something to be admired in the position taken by [Wigan library service on eBooks](https://www.wigan.gov.uk/Resident/Libraries/eMagazines.aspx). 

> Wigan Libraries does not currently offer an ebook lending system.
> Many popular books are not made available for loan in an ebook format by UK publishers, and of those ebooks which are available, many cannot be read on the popular standard Kindle.

They do provide links to a few free online services such as Project Gutenberg.

## Beautiful design goes a long way

I have no design skills. So I tend to prefer things that are functional, and that use boring but clean design patterns. But when seeing sites that have really good designs, it's noticeable. It can go a long way to making the library service enticing.

### Tip

1. Get a designer onto the site!

### Example

Hamphire library service website](https://www.hants.gov.uk/librariesandarchives/library) demonstrates this well. There's quite a lot going on on that site. It's maybe a little overwhelming, and doesn't quite pass the simplicity test, but it makes the library service look like a service that is making a real effort.
