Where are the places in England that don't have a public library? Well, there are loads of places without libraries, what does that mean? More clearly - where are the big towns without a library? Or, the towns that could really do with a library that don't have one?

In 2018 a request was forwarded to Libraries Hacked from the Libraries Taskforce, then part of DCMS. A researcher was trying to find somewhere that didnâ€™t have a public library, where having one would have a significant positive impact on the community.

This was shortly after the [Public libraries in England dataset](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/public-libraries-in-england-basic-dataset) had been released, providing open data on library locations. That could be used to assess the current library network. It was also proposed that [literacy data from the National Literacy Trust and Experian](https://www.experianplc.com/media/latest-news/2017/86-of-english-constituencies-have-entrenched-problems-with-literacy/) could help to find areas in particular need of a library.

This has been on our project list for a long time, but other things got in the way. Also, the Experian/NLT data wasn't appetising. It was at Local Authority Ward level, and those are large and unwieldy administrative geographies, rather than population-based ones. It seemed likely that more detailed deprivation data, such as the [indices of multiple deprivation](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-indices-of-deprivation-2019) would be required, which are published at census-based geographies. They would need to be matched to geographies to find towns, as well as population to assess those towns. It seemed a task destined to sit on the back-burner.

However, The Library and Information Association (CILIP) recently announced an invitation to tender for a project called Future Libraries. It included this introduction:

> The aim is to develop an evidence-based map of how current and future demand for library services is changing and provide a robust basis on which to plan and advocate for future development
>
> **CILIP [Future Libraries](https://www.cilip.org.uk/news/637671/Future-Libraries---invitation-to-tender.htm)**

This seemed to be looking at similar analysis, but with a different focus. Demand is different from need - the CILIP project references future population and infrastructure. We have a library network which is outdated in many respects. Where population centres have changed, as well as shopping habits, the library network has remained static, aside from closures.

Regardless of future planning, it would be useful to go back to that original query, and look at current locations without a library. We found the following open data sources:

- [Libraries in England](https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/supporting-arts-museums-and-libraries/supporting-libraries). Now published by Arts Council England (ACE), the latest is for December 2022.
- [Built Up Areas](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/products/os-open-built-up-areas). A 2022 dataset from Ordnance Survey (OS), representing Built Up Areas of Great Britain, designed to underpin statistical analysis.
- [English indices of deprivation 2019](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-indices-of-deprivation-2019). These are assessments of census-based areas to provide rankings of various deprivation measures.
- [Census 2021](https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/sources/census_2021_bulk). The ONS have released lots of data from the latest census, including population demographics at small census geographies.

### Initial overview

The ACE libraries in England dataset is fairly straightforward to use. After filtering it to extract statutory and staffed public libraries, there are **2564** of these in England.

The OS built-up areas dataset "_enables policy makers and analysts, both nationally and locally, to conduct analysis corresponding to actual urban extents, for example, at a town, city, and village level._". In England there are **7091** of these. A slight flaw, for our requirements, is that it includes areas that are quite large e.g. Bristol. Bristol is large enough city to need many libraries. The data is probably most useful for towns that aren't part of a larger city.

Are all current libraries within built-up areas? Not quite - of the 2564 libraries, **6** were outside of these areas. Those were primarily rural libraries. For example, Dent Library Link in Westmorland and Furness is in a location with a population of just 780. There's nothing wrong with this - [Libraries on the High Street](https://blog.librarydata.uk/libraries-on-the-high-street/) research showed that public libraries appear in many different places, and shouldn't be assumed to be urban. However, such areas are out of scope for this research, as we're primarily looking at places of significant population.

### Areas without a library

Population counts can be added to the built-up areas, using census data. The following are the 3 most populated built-up areas, without a library:

- Horndean, in Hampshire
- Chafford Hundred and West Thurrock, in Thurrock
- Whitefield, in Bury

Online research suggests these are feasible results. Horndean library [closed in 2020](https://www.hants.gov.uk/aboutthecouncil/haveyoursay/consultations/library-consultation), but the continuing necessity for a library seems clear. A new community library has formed, independent from statutory provision. As an unfortunate indication of the value of the old library, the Rhymetime schedule is still listed on the [NHS services directory](https://www.nhs.uk/services/service-directory/rhymetime-horndean-library/N10454438).

A public library in Chafford Hundred was [closed in 2011](https://www.yourthurrock.com/2011/05/09/chafford-hundred-library-to-close-to-public/). Rented by the local authority from the school, it suffered from being stuck between political disagreements, poor opening hours, and was closed by the school, not the local authority. A lesson perhaps of the pitfalls of co-locating services. Chafford Hundred itself is a relatively new settlement, developed in 1985 for an initial 15,000 population that has grown, and never had a dedicated public library.

Similarly, Whitefield. The library and adult learning centre in Whitefield was closed in 2017. A [consultation report on the closure options](https://councildecisions.bury.gov.uk/documents/s12360/01-25-17%20LIBRARY%20-%20APPENDIX%203.pdf) highlighted that the area it served had a high proportion of young people, as well as a high level of deprivation.

### Using this data

Those consultations and closures are in the past. But changes to the library network can be assessed on a national basis, as well as a local one. Should there be a population threshold at which we believe a place needs a library? We have a reasonable concept of the need for schools and hospitals - they are referenced in the National Planning Policy Framework. Shared tools and data would be useful in assessing library provision. Consultations can be challenged, and be made subject to oversight from the DCMS, but at what point is there intervention? Without established guidance on library provision, it primarily comes down to ensuring consultations have been conducted properly.

One problem for consultations is that they often use current usage as a proxy for demand, which is short-term policy. Current usage is too easily misleading - affected by opening hours, variations in measuring usage, current service offer from the library, as well as marketing. The actual population count of an area has its flaws, but it indicates potential usage.

The House of Commons library produced a research report on the classification of towns and cities. It includes specific levels of population that serve to classify settlements:

> **Core Cities**: twelve major population and economic centres<br/>**Other Cities**: other settlements with a population of more than 175,000<br/>**Medium Towns**: settlements with a population between 25,000 and 59,999<br/>**Small Towns**: settlements with a population between 7,500 and 24,999.<br/>**Villages and small communities**: settlements with a population of less than 7,500.
>
> **House of Commons library**. [City & Town Classification of Constituencies & Local Authorities](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8322/)

Using these classifications, we can group the built-up areas, and look at proportions in each that don't have a public library. Note, these aren't definitions of town/city in a traditional sense - they are a classification based upon population. Some 'large towns' in this data will have ceremonial city status, and vice versa.

| Classification                 | % without a library |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| Cities                         | 0%                  |
| Large towns                    | 0%                  |
| Medium towns                   | 0.3%                |
| Small towns                    | 11%                 |
| Villages and small communities | 90%                 |

It is good at least to see that no city or large town is without a library, and almost every medium town has one. However around 11% of small towns do not. As the rest of the small towns do, it is reasonable to expect to have a library in places of that size.

A library service standard could specify that small towns (and above) should all have a library. That would create clear policy on what we expect in library provision. In practice, this is also not too large a change. There are currently **75** built-up areas with a population of over 7,500 that do not have a statutory library. It would not be a huge undertaking to meet that level of service.

For villages and small communities - as the majority do not have a library, it is more difficult to assume they should. But policies shoulddn't restrict having libraries in smaller areas - there would be many where it would be beneficial. Services such as mobile libraries and home library services should also be covering all areas where there is not a permanent library.

## Areas in need of a library

It's worth being cautious around the idea of need. In library consultations it's hugely important. A local authority has an obligation to prioritise the population who most need their services. Who has greatest need of a library? People who can't otherwise get hold of reading material. People who need the health outcomes from events. Those who don't have digital devices and need to use the PCs/tablets. Maybe those who just need to stay warm in the winter.

But for a long-term strategy, we all need libraries, and libraries need to appeal to everyone. That doesn't mean that services shouldn't assess libraries in terms of the lifelines they provide. But it should be a part of any library strategy that they are available and appealing to all, to maximise usage across all demographics.

In assessing need, it could be possible to come up with library specific indicators, such as with literacy data. But the commonly used [indices of deprivation](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-indices-of-deprivation-2019) provide perfectly good assessments across multiple deprivation indicators. These are income, employment, education, health, crime, barriers to housing and services, and living environment. Those are all problems in which it can confidently be said that a library service has a lot to offer a community.

Census areas are assigned a single decile (from 1-10) to give them a multiple index of deprivation, 1 is within the 10% most deprived areas, and 10 would be in the 10% least deprived. These communities tend to be smaller than towns, so a town would contain a variety of different deprivation assessments. There are different ways of aggregating the deprivation within larger areas - one option is to assess each town by the minimum deprivation decile within it. It may be that only 10% of the area is at that level of deprivation, but it best represents the greatest need in the town.

Of the 75 towns, with a population over 7,500, there are **12** that contain communities with a multiple deprivation decile of 1. This analysis could be used to identify priority actions, if looking to 'level-up' certain areas.

### Summary

- Open data on library locations and built-up urban extents can identify settlements that are not currently served by a statutory public library.
- Looking at small towns, with a population of over 7,500, we can estimate that there are 75 without the benefit of a library.
- Prioritising towns with the highest deprivation, a shortlist of **12** are in particular need of library services.

### Further developments

The data, code, and sources for the analysis will be released within the next week.

These insights should be available as interactive dashboards, rather than static reports. The OS Built-Up areas, alongside population and deprivation data, will be made available in the Libraries Hacked [map tool at LibraryMap](https://www.librarymap.co.uk/#/map). This will allow all users and service professionals to explore different settlements and see aspects of missing library provision either nationally or in their local area.
